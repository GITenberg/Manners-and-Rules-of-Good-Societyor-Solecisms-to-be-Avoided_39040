<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">"Manners and Rules of Good Society"</span> contains all
the information comprised in the original work, "Manners
and Tone of Good Society," but with considerable additions.
In a volume of this nature it is necessary to make
constant revisions, and this is periodically done to keep
it up to date, that it may be depended upon as being not
only the most reliable, but also the <i>newest book of etiquette</i>.</p>

<p>A comparison of the number of chapters and their
subjects with those of the early editions would best
demonstrate how the work has grown, not merely in
bulk, but in importance also. This extension has allowed
many subjects to be more exhaustively treated than
heretofore, and it now includes every rule and point that
could possibly be comprehended in its title.</p>

<p>The work throughout its many editions has commended
itself to the attention of thousands of readers, and it is
hoped the present edition will be received by society in
general with the marked success of its predecessors.</p>

<h2 class="mb2">INTRODUCTORY REMARKS</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> title of this work sufficiently indicates the nature of
its contents. The Usages of Good Society relate not only
to good manners and to good breeding, but also to the
proper etiquette to be observed on every occasion.</p>

<p>Not only are certain rules laid down, and minutely
explained, but the most comprehensive instructions are
given in each chapter respecting every form or phase of
the subject under discussion that it may be clearly understood
what <i>is</i> done, or what is <i>not</i> done, in good society,
and also how what <i>is</i> done in good society should be done.
It is precisely this knowledge that gives to men and women
the consciousness of feeling thoroughly at ease in whatever
sphere they may happen to move, and causes them to be
considered well bred by all with whom they may come
in contact.</p>

<p>A solecism may be perhaps in itself but a trifling
matter, but in the eyes of society at large it assumes
proportions of a magnified aspect, and reflects most disadvantageously
upon the one by whom it is committed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the direct inference being, that to be guilty of a solecism
argues the offender to be unused to society, and consequently
not on an equal footing with it. This society
resents, and is not slow in making its disapproval felt by
its demeanour towards the offender.</p>

<p>Tact and innate refinement, though of the greatest
assistance to one unused to society, do not suffice of themselves;
and although counting for much, cannot supply
the want of the actual knowledge of what is customary in
society. Where tact and innate refinement do not exist&mdash;and
this is not seldom the case, as they are gifts bestowed
upon the few rather than upon the many&mdash;then a thorough
acquaintance with the social observances in force in society
becomes more than ever necessary, and especially to those
who, socially speaking, are desirous of making their way
in the world.</p>

<p>Those individuals who have led secluded or isolated
lives, or who have hitherto moved in other spheres than
those wherein well-bred people move, will gather all the
information necessary from these pages to render them
thoroughly conversant with the manners and amenities of
society.</p>

<p>This work will be found of equal service to both
men and women, as in each chapter the points of social
etiquette to be observed by both sexes have been fully
considered.</p>

<p>Those having the charge of young ladies previous to
their introduction into society, either mothers, chaperons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
or governesses, will also derive much useful and practical
information from the perusal of this work, while to those
thoroughly versed in the usages of society it cannot fail
to commend itself, containing as it does many useful and
valuable hints on social questions.</p>

<h1>MANNERS AND RULES OF<br />GOOD SOCIETY</h1>

<h2 class="mt2">CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE MEANING OF ETIQUETTE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">What</span> is etiquette, and what does the word convey? It
is a poor one in itself, and falls very far short of its wide
application. It has an old-fashioned ring about it, savouring
of stiffness, primness, and punctiliousness, which renders
it distasteful to many possessing advanced ideas; and yet
the word etiquette is not so very old either, as Johnson did
not include it in his dictionary, and Walker apologises for
introducing it into his, and according to the authorities he
quotes, it is supposed to be derived from stichos, stichus,
stichetus, sticketta, and from thence to etiquette. But
whether derived from the Latin or the French&mdash;and many
incline to the latter opinion&mdash;there is no doubt that could a
new word be found to replace this much abused one, it
would be a welcome addition to our vocabulary. The
word has unfortunately become associated in our minds
with forms, ceremonies, and observances, in an exaggerated
degree; and it has been so constantly misused and misinterpreted
and misunderstood that ridicule and contempt
have been most unjustly and unfairly thrown upon it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
true meaning of etiquette can hardly be described in
dictionary parlance; it embraces the whole gamut of good
manners, good breeding, and true politeness. One of the
reasons which have no doubt contributed to bring the word
"etiquette" into disrepute, is the manner in which the
subject has been handled by incompetent people, who,
having but a very hazy and obscure knowledge, if any
knowledge at all, yet profess to write guides to polite
manners&mdash;rambling and incoherent guides, which not only
provoke a smile from those better informed, but mislead
and bewilder any one rash enough to consult them, without
previous inquiry as to whether they are safe to follow. A
little caution on this head would insure the most correct
and reliable work being secured amongst so much that is
unreliable. Some people read everything that is written on
the subject of etiquette, not only those who are ignorant
and wish to learn something of its laws, but those who are
thoroughly well versed in them and who, one might suppose,
had nothing to learn; still these latter like to see what is
written, to feel the satisfaction of being supported in their
own knowledge by a well-informed writer; or of finding
amusement in the absurdities gravely advanced by some
one writing from another sphere than that where <i>savoir vivre</i>
reigns. Others attach a very narrow meaning to the word
etiquette, and neither accept it nor understand it in its true
sense; they have an idea that its rules influence and govern
society in general. Rules of etiquette are from their point
of view but trammels and shackles; let them be cast off or
burst through, say they; let every one do as he likes; let all
behave as they like; we are in a free country, why should
we not wipe our mouths upon the table-cloth if we please?
Others again, devour books of etiquette on the quiet; they
are very much in want of instruction as every one knows,
but they have not the courage to confess that they are
awake of this want, and are trying to pick up some knowledge
of this kind to be useful to them; as their aim is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
rise in the social scale, they would not let their friends
know for worlds about this new study, but they know
it, and find that they have improved, that they do not
commit as many <i>gaucheries</i> as heretofore; still, they have
caught the letter rather than the spirit of etiquette, they
have read the rules it prescribes, and act up to them as far
as their memories serve them; but they have failed in one
essential particular of understanding that courtesy, consideration
towards others, and unselfishness, are the sources of
true politeness from which etiquette springs.</p>

<p>There is an idea amongst some few people who have
mixed little in the world, and moved but in one fixed
groove, that the more exalted the sphere, the more perfect
the manners. It is needless to attempt to refute such a
fallacy as this, for examples of the most perfect manner
are to be met with not only amongst those who can boast
of long lineage and high birth, but also amongst those who
lay claim to neither.</p>

<p>Our present code of etiquette is constructed upon the
refinement, polish, and culture of years, of centuries. Wealth
and luxury, and contact with all that is beautiful in art
and nature, have in all ages exercised a powerful influence
on the manners of men; we do not say on the times, as
unfortunately these advantages did not reach down to the
many but were confined to the strictly few; but in these
modern days the many have come, and still come, within
the charmed circle; the ring broadens, ever widens; it is
not now as in olden days that "their lot forbade." On
the contrary, the possession of wealth or of talent is the
open sesame to the most refined and cultured circles.
The word etiquette is too narrow for all it embraces;
it must be viewed in a double light, and be taken from
a moral point as well as from a conventional one. A
kindly nature, and an unselfish spirit are never wanting
in true politeness, but the conventionalities of society give
the finish and completeness to the whole, the colour, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it were, to the picture. In some the conventional spirit
is uppermost and they have at best but a surface polish.
In others the kindly feelings of the heart are allowed full
play, and no act of genuine politeness is omitted or left
undone in their intercourse with their fellows, and these
graces of kindly politeness linger in the memory, trivial
though they may have been, years after one has lost sight
of this true gentleman or thorough lady, and one says of
him, "What a charming man he was, how courteous and
considerate, and how kind!" and of her, "She was the
sweetest and prettiest-mannered woman I ever met."</p>

<p>It is only given to the very few to be thoroughly and
unaffectedly charming without a shadow of self-consciousness
or effort. To assume a would-be charming manner
for the moment, with the desire to be unusually pleasing
to some one in particular, does not confer the enviable
reputation of having a charming manner. It does not sit
easy enough to be altogether natural; it conveys the idea
of being put on for the occasion, and, like all other imitations,
it hardly ever pleases and seldom deceives. Etiquette
and true politeness would have us go further than this,
and our manners of to-day should be our manners of
to-morrow, and not variable according to place and
persons. The world is quick to note these uncertain
demeanours, and every one's measure is readily taken and
retained.</p>

<p>The rules of etiquette are indispensable to the smooth
working of society at large. Take, for example, the
etiquette of precedency, in force both in public and in
private: on every public occasion, and in every private
circle, precedency steps in to render assistance, and is as
necessary in the smallest private circle as in the largest
public gathering, because it assigns to every one his or her
place as far as claim can be laid to place. Mistakes in the
matter of precedency are not only committed by those who
have enjoyed few social advantages, but by those also who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
have had everything in their favour. Young ladies, for
instance, when married from the schoolroom, as it were,
often make grave mistakes on the question of precedency,
if they do not ignore it altogether.</p>

<p>The etiquette of card-leaving and that of paying calls
are indisputably necessary and only the very ignorant
would attempt to gainsay their utility; without these aids
to order and method all intercourse between friends and
acquaintances would be uncertain and chaotic; as it is
there is little excuse when the right thing is not done, and
any departure from the simple rules laid down on these
heads, is the best possible proof of the standing, position,
and associations of the one at fault.</p>

<p>Any one point of etiquette if brought to the bar of
common-sense would be pronounced reasonable, proper,
and sensible; and there is strictly speaking no question of
etiquette that cannot be thus judged and upon which a
like verdict would not be given. There is no one rule of
etiquette that can be described as absurd or ridiculous,
arbitrary or tyrannical, and taken collectively the rules are
but social obligations due from one person to another.
Why should we not be a well-mannered people? Why
should we not be refined, cultivated, and polished in our
demeanour and bearing? Why should we not seek to
charm if we can? Why should we not cultivate and
encourage in ourselves consideration, thoughtfulness, and
graciousness towards others in the smallest details of daily
life?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTIONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> are ceremonious introductions and unceremonious
introductions, premeditated introductions and unpremeditated
introductions; but, in all cases, introductions should
never be indiscriminately made&mdash;that is to say, without
a previous knowledge on the part of those making them
as to whether the persons thus introduced will be likely to
appreciate each other, or the reverse, or unless they have
expressed a desire to become acquainted. For instance, a
lady should not introduce two of her acquaintances residing
in a country town or watering-place, moving in different
circles, unless they have each expressed such a desire.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>An Undesired Introduction</big></b>, if made, compels the
one to whom it is the most unwelcome, to treat the other
with marked coldness, or to continue an acquaintance that
is distasteful.</p>

<p>Should the slightest doubt exist as to how an introduction
will be received&mdash;whether the meditated introduction
is a spontaneous desire on the part of a lady or gentleman,
or whether one person expressed a wish to make the acquaintance
of another person and expressed that wish to a
mutual friend&mdash;the received rule is to consult the wishes of
both persons on the subject before making the introduction.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Difference of Rank</big></b> exists between two
persons, it would be sufficient to ascertain the wishes of the
person of highest rank alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>A person about to make an introduction, should say
to the one lady, but not in the hearing of the other,
"Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, may I introduce Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; to you?"
or some such formula, according to the degree of intimacy
existing between herself and Mrs. A. (See "The Art of
Conversing.")</p>

<p>When two ladies are of equal rank, the wishes of the
person with whom the person making the introduction is
least intimate should be consulted.</p>

<p>In the case of one person having expressed a wish to
make the acquaintance of another, there remains but the
wishes of one person to ascertain.</p>

<p>Acquiescence having been given, the introduction should
be made.</p>

<p>In making an introduction, the lady of lowest rank
should be introduced to the lady of highest rank; in no
case should the lady of highest rank be introduced to the
lady of lowest rank. This point of etiquette should always
be strictly observed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Gentleman should always be introduced to
a Lady</big></b>, whatever his rank may be, without reference to
her rank, whatever it may be. This rule is invariable, and
is based upon the privilege of the sex&mdash;"<i>place aux dames</i>."</p>

<p>It is not usual to ascertain a gentleman's wishes as to
whether he will be introduced to a lady or not, although at
a ball it is usual to do so when the introduction is made
for a special object, viz., that of obtaining a partner for a
lady; and as a gentleman may be either unable or unwilling
to ask the lady to dance, it is incumbent to ascertain beforehand
whether the introduction is desired or not, otherwise
the introduction would be of no avail for the purpose, and
prove a disappointment to the lady.</p>

<p>"Would you like to be introduced to Miss A&mdash;&mdash;?" or
some such polite phrase (see "The Art of Conversing"), is
the sort of formula by which to ascertain a gentleman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
wishes as to an introduction in the ball-room; as ball-room
introductions are understood to mean an intention on the
part of a gentleman to ask a lady to dance or to take her in
to supper.</p>

<p>In general society, gentlemen are supposed to seek,
rather than to avoid the acquaintance of ladies, irrespective
of whatever sets in society to which they belong. It is
immaterial to a gentleman in which set in society his
acquaintances move, and he can be polite to all without
offending any in their several circles.</p>

<p>With regard to his own sex a gentleman is generally as
exclusive as to the acquaintanceships which he forms, as
is a lady with regard to the acquaintanceships which she
forms. Reciprocity of taste is the basis on which acquaintanceships
between men are established, subject, in a certain
measure, to social position; though this rule is itself subject
to wide exceptions.</p>

<p>It is the rule for a gentleman to ask a mutual friend, or
an acquaintance, for an introduction to a lady, and it is the
received rule to do so when a gentleman desires to be introduced
to any lady in particular; but gentlemen do not ask
to be introduced to each other, unless some special reason
exists for so doing&mdash;some reason that would commend itself
to the person whose acquaintance was desired, as well as to
the person making the introduction; otherwise, such a wish
would appear to be either puerile or sycophantic, thus the
request might meet with a refusal, and the proffered
acquaintanceship be declined.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When Introductions are made between Ladies</big></b>,
an unmarried lady should be introduced to a married lady,
unless the unmarried lady is of a higher rank than the
married lady, when the rule is reversed.</p>

<p>The correct formula in use when making introductions
is "Mrs. X&mdash;&mdash;, Lady Z.," thus mentioning the name of the
lady of lowest rank first, as she is the person introduced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the lady of highest rank. "Mrs. X&mdash;&mdash;, Lady Z.," is all
that need be said on the occasion by the person making
the introduction. When the ladies are of equal rank it is
immaterial which name is mentioned first; but there generally
exists sufficient difference in the social position of the
two ladies to give a slight distinction in favour of the one
or of the other, which the person making the introduction
should take into consideration.</p>

<p>When the introduction has been made, the ladies should
bow to each other, and either lady should make a slight
remark.</p>

<p>It is not usual for ladies on being first introduced to
each other to shake hands, but only to bow; but there are
very many exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>When one lady is of higher rank than the other, should
she offer to shake hands, it would be a compliment and a
mark of friendliness on her part.</p>

<p>When a person introduces two intimate friends of his or
hers to each other, they would be expected to shake hands,
instead of bowing only.</p>

<p>The relations of an engaged couple should, on being
introduced, shake hands with both bride and bridegroom
elect, as should the intimate friends of an engaged couple;
as also should the relations of the two families on being
introduced to each other.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of the lady to be the first to offer to
shake hands, in every case, when a gentleman is introduced
to her.</p>

<p>A lady should shake hands with every one introduced to
her in her own house&mdash;that is to say, whether the person is
brought by a mutual friend, or is present by invitation
obtained through a mutual friend.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>At Dinner-parties</big></b>, both small and large, the hostess
should use her own discretion as to the introductions she
thinks proper to make. It is not customary to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
general introductions at a dinner-party; but in sending
guests down to dinner, who are strangers to each other,
the host or hostess should introduce the gentleman to the
lady whom he is to take down to dinner. It would be
quite unnecessary to ask the lady's permission before doing
so. It would be sufficient to make the introduction a few
moments before dinner was announced, and the usual formula
is, "Mrs. A., Mr. B. will take you in to dinner." A
bow is the recognition of this introduction.</p>

<p>When the majority at a dinner-party are strangers to
each other, a host or hostess should introduce one or two
of the principal guests to each other, when time allows of
its being done before dinner is served; such introductions
are oftener made at country dinner-parties than at town
dinner-parties.</p>

<p>A hostess should, in some instances, introduce ladies
to each other in the drawing-room after dinner if the
opportunity offers, and she considers it advisable to do so.</p>

<p>As a rule, a host seldom introduces gentlemen to each
other in the dining-room after dinner, as they address each
other as a matter of course on such occasions.</p>

<p>A hostess should introduce her principal guests to each
other, at five-o'clock teas, garden-parties, small "at homes,"
etc.&mdash;that is to say, gentlemen to ladies&mdash;for the purpose
of their taking the ladies to the tea-room. In this case
also, the introduction should be made without previously
consulting the lady; and a gentleman, knowing the reason
of the introduction, should at once proffer the expected
civility.</p>

<p>At these gatherings a hostess should use her own discretion
as to any general introductions she thinks proper
to make, and should introduce any gentleman to any lady
without previously consulting the lady if she thinks the
introduction will prove agreeable to her.</p>

<p>When introducing ladies to each other, she should
give married ladies, and ladies of rank, the option of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
introduction; but should introduce young unmarried ladies
to each other if she thinks proper.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When Callers arrive simultaneously</big></b>, the hostess
should introduce them directly or indirectly to each other,
if there is no social reason to the contrary.</p>

<p>When a hostess is aware that her visitors do not desire
each other's acquaintanceship, or, if she considers that the
introduction is not altogether a suitable one, agreeable to
both persons, she should not make it, but converse with
each visitor in turn, at the same time not allowing the
conversation to become too general.</p>

<p>At large gatherings, persons desirous of avoiding each
other's acquaintanceship, could be present at the house of
a mutual acquaintance without coming into direct contact
with one another, providing the host and hostess possessed
sufficient tact and discretion not to attempt to effect a
<i>rapprochement</i> between them.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>At Country-house Parties</big></b>, the hostess should introduce
the principal ladies to one another on the first day of
their arrival; but if it is a large party, introductions should
not be generally made, but should be made according to the
judgment of the hostess. The fact of persons being guests
in the same house constitutes in itself an introduction, and
it rests with the guests thus brought together whether the
acquaintanceship ripens into subsequent intimacy or not.</p>

<p>The same remark applies in a degree to afternoon teas
and "at homes." The guests converse with each other if
inclined to do so. The act of so conversing would not
constitute an acquaintanceship, although it might, under
some circumstances, establish a bowing acquaintanceship,
especially between gentlemen.</p>

<p>Ladies should not bow to each other after only exchanging
a few remarks at afternoon tea, or at a garden-party,
unless there were some particular social link between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to warrant their so doing, in which case the lady of highest
rank should take the initiative.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Introductions at Public Balls.</big></b>&mdash;It is erroneous to
suppose that it is the duty of stewards to make introductions
at public balls; it is the exception, and not the
rule, for stewards to introduce persons to each other who
are strangers to themselves.</p>

<p>Society objects, and the stewards object, to making
promiscuous introductions, on the following grounds: first,
as regards the chaperon, whether mother or relative, who
has the charge of a young lady; then as regards a young
lady herself; and last, but not least, as regards the position
occupied by the steward himself. A chaperon naturally
looks and feels displeased when a steward who is a stranger
to herself offers to introduce a man who is evidently a
stranger to him, which fact she gathers by his saying, "This
gentleman wishes to be introduced to your daughter," or
by his asking the stranger his name before making the
introduction. A chaperon is responsible for the acquaintances
a young lady forms while under her charge at a ball,
and if amongst her own friends and acquaintances she
cannot find partners for her, she would prefer that she
spent a comparatively dull evening than that she should
run the risk of forming undesirable acquaintances.</p>

<p>Young ladies have not always the discretion possessed
by their elders, or sufficient knowledge of the world to do
the right thing. Thus, some young ladies would either coldly
decline the introductions, or if the introductions were made,
would as coldly decline to dance, whilst others, anxious to
dance, would accept both the introductions and the partners,
and take their chance as to whether their brothers would
like to see them dancing with strangers thus introduced.
A steward himself particularly dislikes to be made responsible
for a man he does not know; and whether a chaperon
and a young lady are old friends of his, or whether they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
are merely new acquaintances, they equally trust to his not
introducing men to them whom they would not care to
know, and of whom he knows nothing save that they have
solicited an introduction to them.</p>

<p>Very few stewards care to accost a lady whom they
merely know by sight and by name for the purpose of
introducing a stranger; they prefer to decline to make the
introduction, on the plea of not having the honour of the
lady's acquaintance.</p>

<p>Stewards consider that the position of a young man
must be a peculiar one, and his presence at a ball somewhat
of an anomaly, if he does not possess an acquaintance in the
room, through whom he can become known to one or other
of the stewards, or through whom he can be introduced
to any particular lady with whom he may desire to dance.</p>

<p>When a gentleman is introduced to a young lady at a
public ball, it generally means that he is introduced to her
as a partner, and that though he may not ask her for the
next dance, he will for a subsequent one, or that he will
at least offer to take her in to supper, or, if earlier in the
evening, to give her some tea, or if she declines these
civilities, that he will continue a conversation with her until
the next dance commences, or until a dance is over. When
a gentleman does neither of these things, but walks away
as soon as the introduction is made, it is a proof how little
he desired it, and that doubtless the option was not given
him of refusing it.</p>

<p>Good-natured friends of both sexes know how difficult
it is to get partners for well-dressed, well-mannered, good-looking
girls at a ball, unless they are more than ordinarily
attractive in some way or other, in which case they are
popular and sought after, and the only difficulty rests with
the young ladies themselves as to how they shall best apportion
the dances so as to satisfy their numerous partners, or
persuade their chaperons to stay for one more dance which
they have promised to, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a well-known fact in the ball-going world that the
majority of young men insist upon being introduced to the
most popular girls in a ball-room, and refuse being introduced
to one who does not appear to have plenty of partners.</p>

<p>Public balls are in reality made up of a number of
small parties and different sets, each set or party being
entirely independent of the other.</p>

<p>At county balls the county people take large house-parties,
and each house-party does or does not mingle with
other house-parties, according to standing or inclination.</p>

<p>If three large house-parties join forces at a ball they
form a very imposing majority; but there are other sets
in the same ball-room, dancing to the same band and
adjourning to the same supper-room, equally apart and
equally distinct.</p>

<p>At balls held at watering-places, although the residents
do not take large house-parties, yet they join forces with
those residents with whom they are acquainted, reinforced
by friends who come down purposely to be present at the
ball. Thus, on the face of it, a steward's introductions
cannot fail to be ill-received, in whatever set he may be
coerced into making them; and it is well understood that
introductions, to prove acceptable, should only be made
through friends and acquaintances, and even then with tact
and judgment.</p>

<p>As the stewards of a ball are usually the most influential
gentlemen in the place, it naturally follows that they are
acquainted with many, if not with all, of the principal
people present, therefore when they make introductions it
is not by virtue of their office, but simply as a matter of
friendship, and through being personally acquainted with
those introduced by them.</p>

<p>Introductions out of doors are rather a matter of inclination
than not, as, for instance, when a lady is walking
with another lady to whom she is on a visit she should
introduce any friends to her hostess she might happen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
meet, and her hostess should do likewise if time and
opportunity offer for so doing; should any reason exist
for not making an introduction on the part of either lady,
it should be explained when they are again alone, as were
either of the ladies to exclude the other from the conversation
it would be considered discourteous towards the one
excluded. When two ladies accidentally meet when out
walking, and are subsequently joined by two or more ladies,
introductions should not be made by either of the ladies,
unless some special reason exists for so doing. A lady, as
a rule, should not introduce gentlemen to each other unless
one of them is her host, when it would be correct to do so.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>How to act on the Occasion of an Introduction</big></b> is
determined almost entirely upon the reason for its being
made, and by whom and to whom the person is introduced.
Even the <i>locale</i> has something to do with it, and thus a
variety of issues are raised, upon which an instantaneous
judgment has to be given. The mind has to travel with
lightning rapidity over the ground to arrive at a correct
course of action; but the mind does not always respond to
the call made upon it: it hesitates, and acts not upon the
outcome of reflection, but upon the spur of the moment.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Received Rule is not to shake hands</big></b>, but
merely to bow on being introduced; but this rule under certain
circumstances would not meet the case; it would disappoint
the one introducing and the one introduced. For instance
if a relative of the former is the person introduced a bow
would be a very chilling response to the introduction made;
to shake hands, on the contrary, would be the correct thing
to do, and both persons should offer at the same moment
this cordial recognition. On the other hand, if a casual
introduction is made without any premeditation, and those
introduced are totally unknown to each other, an exchange
of bows is all that is required of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Amongst the Exceptions for not merely bowing</big></b>
on being introduced are the introductions made between
young ladies and elderly ones, and between young ladies
themselves. An elderly lady, as a general rule, shakes
hands with a girl introduced to her with the idea of being
cordial and kind, not to say condescending, and girls
generally shake hands with each other in place of bowing,
as acquaintanceships formed by them have not the importance
that attaches to those of older ladies; besides, a greater
readiness to make friends is the privilege and characteristic
of youth.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Men take very much the Same View</big></b> as regards
introductions as do women&mdash;that is to say, if an introduction
is made by a relative of the man introduced, the men would
shake hands and not merely bow. This holds equally good
where intimate friends are concerned: they almost rank on
the footing of relations, and a cordial reception is given to
an introduction thus made. When casual introductions are
made of necessity rather than of intention men do not
shake hands. When "I think you have met A." or "I
think you know Mr. A." is said&mdash;the one by a host and
the other by a hostess&mdash;nothing further is required from
either than a bow and a smile of acquiescence accepting the
introduction and a disclaimer is not expected if "Mr. A." is
not actually known. The uncertainty is an excuse for
making the introduction.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Ladies do not rise from their Seats on being introduced
either at an "At Home"</big></b> or before dinner is
announced, or after dinner, or when calling when people are
introduced to them, or when they themselves are introduced.
Half an exception occurs, it is true, at crowded "at homes,"
when to rise and talk to the lady introduced is almost a
necessity: there is no vacant seat for her to take, and,
therefore, if both do not stand, conversation is at a deadlock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
as the few first conventional remarks made by either are
lost in the general buzz going on around; also, it is awkward
and ungraceful for a lady to bend over one seated for the
purpose of saying a few platitudes. "Introductory remarks,"
or remarks following upon introductions, have too often a
melancholy ring of commonplaceness about them and are
distinctly trite. How can they be otherwise? To venture
out of the commonplace into originality would be suspicious
of eccentricity, and no one wishes to be considered a little
odd.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Before and after Dinner, when Introductions are
made</big></b> between ladies it is to those seated near to each
other, and, therefore, there would be no occasion to rise, as
there might be at an "at home." There is no question of a
lady rising from her seat when a man is introduced to her,
unless that man is her host, when she should rise and shake
hands with him, or a clerical dignity&mdash;a bishop for instance,
if opportunity allows of it, and on a semi-official occasion.
This question does not trouble men, as they are usually
found standing, or they are brought up to a person to be
introduced, and even if a man ventures upon sitting down
at an "at home," or before dinner is announced, he springs
to his feet with alacrity when any approach is made in the
matter of introducing him to a fellow guest.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Introductions often have to be made at Afternoon
Calls</big></b>, supposing that two or three callers only are
present and the hostess feels that she must render the talk
general by making some kind of introduction, direct or
indirect, as she thinks best. The ladies thus introduced
remain seated and bow. They do not shake hands even
under the exceptional conditions previously referred to, but
they would at once join in the talk that passes for conversation,
and on departure would shake hands with the relative
in question after having shaken hands with the hostess and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
having expressed pleasure at meeting this near relative&mdash;mother
or sister, or whoever she may happen to be.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Introductions between Callers</big></b> made under enforced
circumstances have not much bearing on future acquaintance.
Those introduced pass so short a time in each other's
company, and know practically nothing of each other's
surroundings, that they are uncertain whether at future
meetings they ought to recollect that such introductions
have taken place, and whether they should bow or forget.
Actually it would be correct to bow if the opportunity is
given so to do, but unless the wish to bestow recognition is
mutual it is of little avail if grudgingly given, and it would
be worse still were it withheld. Some people have short
memories for faces, and others are short-sighted, and both
these drawbacks have to be reckoned with when expecting
recognition from a person to whom one has been thus
introduced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>LEAVING CARDS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> etiquette of card-leaving is a privilege which society
places in the hands of ladies to govern and determine their
acquaintanceships and intimacies, to regulate and decide
whom they will, and whom they will not visit, whom they
will admit into their friendship, and whom they will keep
on the most distant footing, whose acquaintance they wish
further to cultivate and whose to discontinue.</p>

<p>It would seem that the act of leaving cards is but
imperfectly understood, and that many erroneous impressions
prevail respecting the actual use of visiting cards.
The object of leaving cards is to signify that a call has
been made, due civility shown, and a like civility expected
in return.</p>

<p>Leaving cards, or card-leaving, is one of the most important
of social observances, as it is the ground-work or
nucleus in general society of all acquaintanceships. Leaving
cards, according to etiquette, is the first step towards
forming, or towards enlarging, a circle of acquaintances,
and the non-fulfilment of the prescribed rules is a sure step
in the opposite direction. The following is the received
code of card-leaving in all its details according to the
etiquette observed in good society by both ladies and gentlemen,
and should be faithfully followed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady's Visiting Card</big></b> should be printed in
small, clear copper-plate script, and free from any kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
embellishment as regards ornamental or Old English letters.
It should not be a thin card, and should be three inches
and five eighths in width, and slightly under two and a half
in depth.</p>

<p>The name of the lady should be printed in the centre of
the card, and her address in the left-hand corner. If she
has a second address, it should be printed in the opposite
corner of the card. If the second address is but a temporary
one, it is usually written and not printed.</p>

<p>A married lady should never use her christian name on
a card, but she should use her husband's christian name
before her surname if his father or elder brother is living.</p>

<p>It is now considered old-fashioned for husbands and
wives to have their names printed on the same card,
although at watering-places, the practice of having the two
names on the same card, "Mr. and Mrs. Dash," is still
occasionally followed; but even when these cards are used,
a lady and gentleman still require separate cards of their
own.</p>

<p>A lady having a large acquaintance should keep a visiting
book, in which to enter the names of her acquaintances,
and the date when their cards were left upon her, with the
dates of her return cards left upon them, that she might
know whether a card were due to her from them, or whether
it were due to them from her.</p>

<p>A lady having a small acquaintance would find a memorandum
book sufficient for the purpose; a line should be
drawn down the centre of every page, dividing it into two
columns, the one column for the names, and the opposite
column for the dates of the calls made and returned.</p>

<p>Leaving cards principally devolves upon the mistress of
a house; a wife should leave cards for her husband, as well
as for herself; and a daughter for her father. The master
of a house has little or no card-leaving to do, beyond
leaving cards upon his bachelor friends.</p>

<p>In the country it is otherwise, and those who return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
home are called upon by their friends and acquaintances
in the first instance, unless under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Ladies arriving in town should leave cards on their
acquaintances and friends to intimate that they have
returned.</p>

<p>Visiting cards should be left in person, and should not
be sent by post, although in town, when the distance is
considerable, it is tacitly allowed; but, as a rule, ladies
invariably leave their cards themselves. On arriving in
town for the season ladies having a large acquaintance
often send their visiting cards to their various friends and
acquaintances by a man-servant or through a stationer.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Routine of Card-leaving.</big></b>&mdash;As regards the
routine of card-leaving. When driving, a lady should
desire her footman to inquire if the mistress of the house
at which she is calling is "at home." If not "at home,"
and it is a first call, she should hand him <i>three</i> cards&mdash;<i>one</i>
of her own, and <i>two</i> of her husband's. Her card is left
for the mistress of the house, and her husband's cards for
both master and mistress.</p>

<p>If not a first call a lady should leave one only of
her husband's cards if his acquaintance with her friend's
husband is an intimate one and they are in the habit of
meeting frequently. If, on the contrary, they know each
other but slightly, and meet but seldom, then two of his
cards should be left. This, however, not on every occasion
of calling.</p>

<p>When a lady is merely leaving cards, she should hand
the three cards to her servant, saying, "For Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;."
This ensures the cards being left at the right address, and
is the correct formula for the occasion.</p>

<p>When a lady is walking, and finds the mistress of the
house at which she calls is "not at home," she should act
as above.</p>

<p>When a lady intends making a call she should ask if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
"Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; is at home?" And if the answer is in the
affirmative, she should, after making the call, leave <i>two</i> of
her husband's cards on the hall table, and neither put them
in the card-basket nor leave them on the drawing-room
table, nor offer them to her hostess, all of which would be
very incorrect; but she might on reaching the hall hand
them to the man-servant silently, or she might send them
in by her own servant when seated in her carriage, saying,
"For Mr. and Mrs. Smith." She should not leave her <i>own</i>
card on the hall table, as, having seen the lady of the
house, the reason for doing so no longer exists.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>When a lady calling is accompanied by her husband and
the mistress of the house is at home, the husband should
leave one of his cards only, for the absent master of the
house; when the master of the house is at home also, a
card in that case should not be left.</p>

<p>When the mistress of a house has a grown-up daughter
or daughters, the lady leaving cards should turn down one
corner of her visiting card&mdash;the right-hand corner generally&mdash;to
include the daughter or daughters in the call.
This custom of turning down a corner of a visiting card
signifies that other ladies of the family besides the hostess
are included in the call. A foreigner turns down the <i>end</i>
of a card instead of one corner only, which has not the
same signification. It is to denote that he has left it in
person.</p>

<p>A lady should not leave one of her husband's cards for
the daughters of the house, but she not unfrequently leaves
his card for the grown-up sons of the house.</p>

<p>When a lady intends leaving cards on a friend who is
the guest of some one with whom she is unacquainted, she
should only leave cards for her friend and not for her
friend's hostess; but if she is slightly acquainted with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
friend's hostess, she should leave cards upon her on the
occasion of her first visit to her friend, but it would not be
necessary to do so at every subsequent visit, especially if
they were of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Young ladies should not have visiting cards of their own;
their names should be printed beneath that of their mother
on her card. In the case of there being no mother living,
the daughter's name should be printed beneath that of her
father on the usual lady's visiting card, but never on the
smaller cards used by gentlemen. When young ladies are
taken out into society by relatives or friends, their names
should be written in pencil under the names of the ladies
chaperoning them on their visiting cards.</p>

<p>Maiden ladies of a certain age should have visiting cards
of their own, but until a young lady has attained what is
termed a certain age, it argues no little independence of
action to have a card of her own; but when she no longer
requires chaperonage, she is entitled to a card of her own,
being clearly her own mistress, and able to choose her own
acquaintances.</p>

<p>When a young lady is on a visit unaccompanied by her
parents, and wishes to call on ladies with whom the lady
she is staying with is unacquainted, she should leave her
mother's card on which her own name is also printed, and
should draw a pencil through her mother's name to intimate
that she was not with her on that occasion.</p>

<p>Cards should always be returned within a week if
possible, or ten days at latest, after they have been left, but
to do so within a week is more courteous. And care must
be taken to return the "call" or "cards" according to the
etiquette observed by the person making the call or leaving
the card; that is to say, that a "call" must <i>not</i> be returned
by a card only, or a "card" by a "call." This is a point
ladies should be very punctilious about.</p>

<p>Should a lady of higher rank return a card by a "call,"
asking if the mistress of the house were "at home," her so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
doing would be in strict etiquette; and should she return
a "call" by a card only, it should be understood that she
wished the acquaintance to be of the slightest; and should a
lady call upon an acquaintance of higher rank than herself,
who had only left a card upon her, her doing so would be
a breach of etiquette.</p>

<p>In large establishments the hall porter enters the names
of all callers in a book expressly kept for the purpose, while
some ladies merely desire their servant to sort the cards
left for them.</p>

<p>The name of the lady or gentleman for whom the cards
are intended should never be written on the cards left at a
house. The only case in which it should be done would be
when cards are left on a lady or a gentleman staying at a
crowded hotel, when, to save confusion, and to ensure their
receiving them, their names should be written on them thus:
"For Mr. and Mrs. Smith." But this would be quite an exceptional
case, otherwise to do so would be extremely vulgar.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Leaving Cards after Entertainments.</big></b>&mdash;Visiting
cards should be left after the following entertainments:
balls, receptions, private theatricals, amateur concerts, and
dinners, by those who have been invited, whether the invitations
have been accepted or not, and should be left the
day after the entertainment if possible, and certainly within
the week according to the rules of card-leaving already
described. On these occasions cards should be left without
inquiry as to whether the hostess is at home, although after
a dinner-party it is the rule to ask if she is at home, as to
dine at a house denotes a greater intimacy than being
present at a large gathering. If the hostess were not at
home, cards should be left.</p>

<p>If a lady has been but once present at any entertainment,
whether the invitation came through a mutual friend
or direct from the hostess herself, the hostess being but a
slight acquaintance of her own, besides leaving cards on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
her the day following, she can, if she desires, leave cards on
her the following season, or, if residing in the same town,
within a reasonable time of the entertainment; but if these
cards are not acknowledged by cards being left in return,
she should of course understand that the acquaintance is to
proceed no further.</p>

<p>A lady should not leave cards on another lady to whom
she has but recently been introduced at a dinner-party or
afternoon tea; for instance, she must meet her several times
in society, and feel sure that her acquaintance is desired,
before venturing to leave cards. If two ladies are of equal
rank, tact will be their best guide as to the advisability
of leaving cards or not upon each other; the lady of
superior rank may take the initiative if she pleases. If
either of the ladies express a wish to further the acquaintance
by asking the other to call upon her, the suggestion
should come from the lady of highest rank; if of equal
rank it is immaterial as to which first makes the suggestion.
But in either case the call should be paid within the week.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Leaving Cards upon New-comers.</big></b>&mdash;In the country
the residents should be the first to leave cards on the new-comers,
after ascertaining the position which the new-comers
occupy in society.</p>

<p>Persons moving in the same sphere should either leave
cards or call according as they intend to be ceremonious
or friendly, and the return visits should be paid in like
manner, a card for a card, a call for a call.</p>

<p>It is the received rule that residents should call on new-comers,
although having no previous acquaintance with
them, or introductions to them.</p>

<p>New-comers, even if of higher rank, should not call
on residents in the first instance, but should wait until the
residents have taken the initiative. If residents do not
wish to continue the acquaintance after the first meeting,
it is discontinued by not leaving cards, or by not calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
again, and if the new-comers feel disinclined to continue
the acquaintance they should return the calls by leaving
cards only. Calling on new-comers in the country should
not be done indiscriminately, and due consideration should
be paid to individual status in society.</p>

<p>The lady of highest social position in the circle to which
the new-comers belong generally takes the responsibility
of calling first on the new-comers. By new-comers is
expressed persons who intend to reside in a county or town
for a long, or even for a short period, and who are not
casual visitors in the place.</p>

<p>The custom of residents calling on new-comers is entirely
confined to county society, and does not apply to residents
in large towns and populous watering-places.</p>

<p>In old cathedral cities and quiet country towns, far from
the metropolis, on the contrary, the rule holds good of
residents calling on new-comers.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Cards "To Inquire."</big></b>&mdash;Cards to inquire after friends
during their illness should be left in person, and should not
be sent by post; but they may be sent by a servant. On
a lady's visiting card should be written above the printed
name: "To inquire after Mrs. Smith." When the person
inquired after is sufficiently recovered to return thanks in
person, the usual visiting card, with "many thanks for kind
inquiries," written above the printed name, is the usual mode
of returning thanks, and is all-sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>P.P.C. Cards.</big></b>&mdash;Formerly P.P.C. cards were left
within a week of departure, or within ten days if the
acquaintance was a large one.</p>

<p>The letters P.P.C. for <i>pour prendre cong&eacute;</i>, written at the
lower corner of visiting cards, indicate departure from town
or from a neighbourhood. P.P.C. cards may be left in
person or sent by a servant; they can also be sent by post.
The object of leaving P.P.C. cards is to avoid leave-takings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and correspondence concerning departure, and to prevent
offence being given if letters and invitations remained unanswered.</p>

<p>In the country an absence of from three to six months
renders leaving P.P.C. cards somewhat necessary; under that
period it would be unnecessary to give notice of a temporary
absence which does not amount to an actual departure.
Short absences render it unnecessary to leave P.P.C. cards.
Holiday movements at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide
are thoroughly recognised, and no leave-taking is obligatory.
P.P.C. cards are now seldom if ever left in town.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Business Calls.</big></b>&mdash;When a lady makes a strictly business
call upon either a lady or gentleman she should give
her card to the servant to be taken to his master or mistress,
but on no other occasion should she do so.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gentlemen's Visiting Cards.</big></b>&mdash;A gentleman's card
should be thin&mdash;thick cards are not in good taste&mdash;and not
glazed, and of the usual narrow width, <i>i.e.</i> one and a half
inches in depth, and three inches in width; his name should
be printed in the centre, thus: "Mr. Smith" or "Mr.
Francis Smith," should he require the addition of his christian
name to distinguish him from his father or elder brother.
To have "Francis Smith" printed on the card without the
prefix of "Mr." would be in bad taste.</p>

<p>Initials appertaining to honorary rank should never be
written or printed on a card, such as D.L., K.C., M.P.,
K.C.B., M.D., etc. Military or professional titles necessarily
precede the surname of the person bearing them, and
are always used, such as "Colonel Smith," "Captain Smith,"
"Rev. H. Smith," "Dr. Smith," etc.</p>

<p>As regards titles, "The Honourable" is the only title
that is not used on a visiting card. Thus "The Honourable
Henry Smith's" card should bear the words "Mr. Henry
Smith" only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A Baronet's card should be printed thus, "Sir George
Smith," and a Knight's card thus, "Sir Charles Smith." A
gentleman's address should be printed in the left hand
corner of the card. If a member of a club, it is usual to
print the name of the club at the right hand. Officers
usually have the name of the club printed at the left hand
corner in the place of the address, and the regiment to
which they belong at the right hand.</p>

<p>Cards should be printed in small copper-plate script,
without ornamentation of any kind. Old English letters
look old-fashioned on a card, and are but little used; and
ornamental capital letters are never used, and are out of
date. The lettering should be as plain and as free from
any sort of embellishment as it well can be.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Routine of Card-leaving for Gentlemen.</big></b>&mdash;To
bachelors card-leaving is an irksome routine of etiquette,
and is, therefore, in a measure often neglected, by reason
of their having little or no leisure at command during the
afternoon hours. This is now thoroughly understood and
accepted in general society. When, however, a bachelor
has his way to make in society and has leisure to further
the acquaintanceships he has already made, he should follow
the rules of card-leaving.</p>

<p>Bachelors, as a rule, are expected to leave cards on
the master and mistress of a house with whom they are
acquainted as soon as they are aware that the family have
arrived in town; or if a bachelor himself has been away, he
should leave cards on his acquaintances immediately after
his return. He should leave one card for the mistress of
the house and one for its master.</p>

<p>A gentleman should not turn down a corner of his card,
even though he may be acquainted with other ladies of the
family besides the mistress of the house. A gentleman
should not leave a card for the young daughters of the
house, or for any young relative of its mistress who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
be staying with her; but if a married couple with whom
he is acquainted were staying with the friends on whom he
is calling, he should leave two cards for them, one for the
wife and one for the husband, and should tell the servant
for whom they are intended.</p>

<p>As regards leaving cards upon new acquaintances, a
gentleman should not leave his card upon a married lady,
or the mistress of a house, to whom he has been introduced,
however gracious or agreeable she has been to him, unless
she expressly asks him to call, or gives him to understand
in an unmistakable manner that his doing so would be
agreeable to her. This rule holds good, whether the introduction
has taken place at a dinner-party, at a ball, at an
"at home," at a country-house gathering, or elsewhere;
he would not be entitled to leave his card on her on
such slight acquaintanceship; as, if she desired his further
acquaintance, she would make some polite allusion to his
calling at her house, in which case he should leave his card
on her as soon afterwards as convenient, and he should also
leave a card for the master of the house, the lady's husband
or father (as the case may be), even if he had not made his
acquaintance when making that of the lady.</p>

<p>A gentleman should not leave a card on a young lady
to whom he has been introduced, but upon her mother or
the relative with whom she is residing.</p>

<p>When the acquaintance existing between gentlemen is
but slight, they should occasionally leave cards upon each
other, especially when they do not move in the same circle,
and are not otherwise likely to meet; it generally follows
that the one who most desires the acquaintanceship is the
one to leave his card first, always supposing that the
strength of the acquaintance would warrant his so doing.
The one of highest rank should be the one to intimate that
he desires the acquaintance of the other; if the rank be
equal, it is a matter of inclination which calls first.</p>

<p>The rules of etiquette, though stringent as regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
acquaintances, have little or no application as regards
intimate friends; friendship overrules etiquette.</p>

<p>When a bachelor has a number of intimate friends, very
little card-leaving is required from him as far as they are
concerned.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Leaving Cards after Entertainments.</big></b>&mdash;In the
event of a gentleman receiving an invitation to an entertainment
from an acquaintance, or from a new acquaintance,
or through some mutual friend, he should leave his cards
at the house within a week or ten days after the entertainment,
one for the mistress and one for the master of the
house, whether he has accepted the invitation or not.
Between friends this rule is greatly relaxed.</p>

<p>It is usual for a gentleman to leave his cards on the
host or on the hostess, after every entertainment to which
he has been invited by them, whether it be a dinner-party,
or ball, or "at home," etc. Whether he has been present
or not, the fact of his having been invited by them obliges
him to pay them this civility, although great latitude as
regards time is now accorded in general society with regard
to this particular rule.</p>

<p>If invited by a new acquaintance, the cards should be
left a few days after the entertainment, but if by a less
recent acquaintance they should be left within ten days or
a fortnight, but the earlier the cards are left the greater the
politeness shown.</p>

<p>If a bachelor acquaintance gives an entertainment, the
same rule applies as to the necessity of cards being left on
him by those gentlemen but slightly acquainted with him
who have been invited to the entertainment.</p>

<p>When a gentleman has been invited to an entertainment
given at the house of a new acquaintance, whether the
acquaintance be a lady or a gentleman, it would be etiquette
for him to leave his card upon them on their arrival in town
or elsewhere, even though they may not have invited him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to any subsequent entertainment given by them within the
year. If during the following year they do not again invite
him, he might consider the acquaintance at an end and
cease to call. These complimentary calls made, or rather
cards left, should not average more than four during the
year.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Memorial Cards</big></b> are out of date in society, and consequently
should not be sent to either relatives or friends.</p>

<p>A widow should not make use of her christian name on
her visiting cards to distinguish her from other members of
her late husband's family. Her cards should be printed as
during his lifetime.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>PAYING CALLS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Ladies</span> stand upon strict and ceremonious etiquette with
each other as regards both paying and receiving calls.
Ignorance or neglect of the rules which regulate paying
calls, brings many inconveniences in its train; for instance,
when a lady neglects to pay a call due to an acquaintance,
she runs the risk of herself and daughters being excluded
from entertainments given by the said acquaintance.</p>

<p>When a call has not been made within a reasonable
time, a coldness is apt to arise between ladies but slightly
acquainted with each other. Some ladies take this omission
good-naturedly or indifferently, while with others the
acquaintance merges into a mere bowing acquaintance to
be subsequently dropped altogether.</p>

<p>The first principle of calling is, that those who are the
first to arrive in town should be the <i>first</i> to call upon their
acquaintances to intimate their return.</p>

<p>"Morning calls," so designated on account of their
being made before dinner, are, more strictly speaking,
"afternoon calls," as they should only be made between
the hours of three and six o'clock.</p>

<p>Calls made in the morning&mdash;that is before one o'clock&mdash;would
not come under the denomination of "morning
calls," as they can only be made by intimate friends and
not by acquaintances, and are not, therefore, amenable to
the rules of etiquette which govern the afternoon calls,
which calls are regulated in a great measure&mdash;as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hour of calling&mdash;by the exact degree of intimacy existing
between the person who calls and the person called upon.
From three to four o'clock is the ceremonious hour for
calling; from four to five o'clock is the semi-ceremonious
hour; and from five to six o'clock is the wholly friendly
and without ceremony hour.</p>

<p>If a lady is driving when she calls at the house of
an acquaintance, she should say to her servant, "Ask if
Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; is at home."</p>

<p>When a lady is walking, she should ask the same
question herself.</p>

<p>When the answer is in the negative, she should leave
one of her own cards and one of her husband's, and should
say to the servant, "For Mr. and Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>When the answer is in the affirmative, the lady should
enter the house without further remark and follow the
servant to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The servant should go before the visitor, to lead the
way to the drawing-room, and, however accustomed a
visitor may be to a house, it is still the proper etiquette for
the servant to lead the way, and announce him or her to
his mistress; and this rule should not be dispensed with,
except in the case of very near relations or very intimate
friends.</p>

<p>At the drawing-room door the servant waits for a
moment until the visitor has reached the landing, when the
visitor should give his or her name to the servant, "Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash;" or "Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;," should the servant be unacquainted
with it.</p>

<p>If the visitor calling bears the title of "Honourable" it
should not be mentioned by him or her to the servant
when giving the name, neither should it be mentioned by
the servant when announcing the visitor.</p>

<p>All titles are given in full by the servants of those who
bear them, thus: "The Duke and Duchess of A&mdash;&mdash;,"
"The Marquis and Marchioness of B&mdash;&mdash;," "The Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and Countess of C&mdash;&mdash;," "Viscount and Viscountess
D&mdash;&mdash;," "Lord and Lady E&mdash;&mdash;," etc.; but a marchioness,
a countess, or a viscountess when giving her name to be
announced at a morning call would style herself "Lady
A&mdash;&mdash;" only.</p>

<p>A gentleman or lady should never give his or her visiting
card to the servant when the mistress of the house is at
home.</p>

<p>A servant should not knock at the drawing-room door
when announcing visitors. The servant, on opening the
drawing-room door, should stand inside the doorway, he
should not stand behind the door, but well into the room;
facing the mistress of the house if possible, and should say,
"Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;," or "Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>When the mistress of the house is not in the drawing-room
when a visitor arrives, the visitor should seat herself
and rise at her entrance.</p>

<p>Visitors should not make any inquiries of the servant as
to how long his mistress will be, or where she is, or what
she is doing, etc. Visitors are not expected to converse
with the servants of their acquaintances, and should not
enter into conversation with them.</p>

<p>Formerly a gentleman when calling, took his hat and
stick in his hand with him into the drawing-room, and
held them until he had seen the mistress of the house
and shaken hands with her. He either placed them on
a chair or table near at hand or held them in his hand,
according as to whether he felt at ease or the reverse,
until he took his leave. Many middle-aged and elderly
men still follow this fashion in a degree, and take their
hats and sticks into the drawing-room when making formal
calls.</p>

<p>The newer fashion amongst younger men is to leave
their hats and sticks in the hall and not to take them into
the drawing-room with them when calling. To do this is
now very general, as hats are in the way if tea is going on;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
besides, men were apt to forget where they placed their
hats, and frequently had to return to the drawing-room
in search of them.</p>

<p>At "at homes," small afternoon teas, luncheons, dinners,
etc., the rule is the same, and hats are left in the hall by
invited guests.</p>

<p>A gentleman should not take his stick or umbrella with
him into the drawing-room, but leave it in the hall.</p>

<p>When gentlemen wear gloves, they can take them off
or keep them on as they please, it is immaterial which
they do, but when a call is made when tea is going on, it
is more usual to take them off.</p>

<p>When the mistress of the house is in the drawing-room
when a visitor is announced&mdash;and she should so arrange
her occupations as always to be found there on the afternoons
when she intends being "at home" should visitors
call&mdash;she should rise, come forward, and shake hands with
her visitor. She should not ask her visitor to be seated,
or to "take a seat," but she might say, "Where will you
sit?" or, "Will you sit here?" or something to this effect;
and should at once sit down and expect her visitor to do
the same, as near to herself as possible.</p>

<p>Both hostess and visitor should guard against displaying
a fussy demeanour during a morning call, as a morning call
is oftener than not a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> between two
persons but slightly acquainted with each other requires a
considerable amount of tact and <i>savoir vivre</i> to be sustained
with ease and self-possession. A fussy woman is
without repose, without dignity, and without <i>savoir vivre</i>.</p>

<p>A hostess betrays that she is not much accustomed to
society when she attempts to amuse her visitor by the
production of albums, photographs, books, illustrated newspapers,
portfolios of drawings, the artistic efforts of the
members of the family, and the like; conversation being
all that is necessary, without having recourse to pictorial
displays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>If not intimate enough to refer to family matters, the
conversation should turn on light topics of the hour.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>People unused to society are apt to fall back upon the
above adventitious aids. A hostess should rely solely upon
her own powers of conversation to make the short quarter
of an hour&mdash;which is the limit of a ceremonious call&mdash;pass
pleasantly to her visitor. The hostess should not offer
her visitor any refreshments, wine and cake, for instance.
No refreshments whatever, save tea, should be offered to
morning visitors; they are not supposed to require them.</p>

<p>In the country it is customary to offer sherry to gentlemen
callers, and to order tea for the ladies, even though
the call is made rather early in the afternoon, and a little
before the hour for having tea.</p>

<p>Ceremonious visits are usually paid before the hour of
half-past four; but if tea is brought in while the visitor is
in the drawing-room, or if the visitor calls while the hostess
is having tea, she should naturally offer her visitor tea.</p>

<p>When the mistress of the house only expects a few
callers, "tea" is placed on a small table&mdash;a silver tray
being generally used for the purpose. The hostess should
pour out the tea herself; when a gentleman is present, he
should hand the cups to the visitors or visitor, otherwise
the hostess should herself do so, and then hand the sugar
and cream, without asking whether her visitors will have
either, unless she is preparing the cups of tea herself, in
which case she should ask the question.</p>

<p>When a second visitor arrives, ten or fifteen minutes
after the first visitor, the first visitor should take her leave
as soon as she conveniently can. When the second visitor
is a lady, the hostess should rise and shake hands with her,
and then seat herself; the first visitor, if a lady, should not
rise; if a gentleman, he should do so.</p>

<p>A hostess should also rise and come forward when a
gentleman is announced; this gives her an opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
talking to him for a few moments on his first entering the
room. The second visitor should at once seat him or
herself near to the hostess.</p>

<p>She should introduce the callers to each other unless
she has some especial reason for not doing so. She could,
however, in the course of conversation merely mention the
name of each caller, so that each may become aware of
the name of the other. This is now often done when
formal introductions are not made. If the hostess possesses
tact, and a facility and readiness of speech, she
should skilfully draw both callers into the conversation (a
subject which is fully enlarged upon in "The Art of
Conversing"). The hostess should not take this latter
course unless aware that the two visitors would be likely
to appreciate each other.</p>

<p>When one visitor arrives immediately after the other,
the hostess should converse equally with both visitors, and
the lady who was the first to arrive should be the first to
leave, after a call of from ten to fifteen minutes. When
only one visitor is present the hostess should accompany
her to the door of the drawing-room, and linger for a few
moments, whilst the visitor is descending the stairs. To
do so would not be imperative, but it would be courteous.
When the host is present he should accompany the lady
downstairs into the hall; this also is an optional civility,
and greatly depends upon the estimation in which the lady
is held by host and hostess.</p>

<p>When two visitors are present the hostess should rise
and shake hands with the departing visitor; but unless a
person of greater consideration than the visitor who still
remained seated, she should not accompany her to the
drawing-room door.</p>

<p>One visitor should not rise from her seat when another
is about to take her leave. When visitors are acquainted
with each other they should rise and shake hands. When
one of the visitors is a gentleman he should rise, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unacquainted with the lady who is about to take her leave;
he should not remain seated when the hostess is standing.</p>

<p>When two visitors, either two ladies or two gentlemen,
have slightly conversed with each other during a morning
call, they should not shake hands with each other on
leaving, but should merely bow. When they have not
spoken to each other, they should not bow.</p>

<p>When they have been formally introduced they should
still only bow, unless the acquaintance has progressed into
sudden intimacy through previous knowledge of each other.</p>

<p>When one of the visitors present is a gentleman he
should open the drawing-room door for the departing
visitor, but he should not accompany her downstairs unless
requested by the hostess to do so; the visitor should bow
to him and thank him, but not shake hands with him.</p>

<p>When the hostess has shaken hands with a guest, and
before crossing the room with her, she should ring the
drawing-room bell, that the servant may be in readiness in
the hall to open the door. She should ring the bell even if
the host were accompanying the lady downstairs. It would
be thoughtless on the part of the hostess to forget to ring
the bell to give notice to the servant that a visitor was
leaving.</p>

<p>In the country, the caller before rising to depart sometimes
asks if she may ring for her motor-car to come round.
When the hostess is in reach of the bell, she should ring
it for her; when a gentleman is present, he should do so.
On the servant's entrance, the caller should say, "My
motor-car, please!"</p>

<p>When a lady is calling on a friend, the guest of some one
with whom she herself is unacquainted, or even but slightly
acquainted, she should in both cases ask if her friend is at
home, and not if the mistress of the house is at home; and
having paid her visit, on leaving the house she should leave
cards for its mistress if she is slightly acquainted with her,
but should not do so if she is unacquainted with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>When a lady has a guest staying on a visit to her, if
convenient, she should, when her guest expected visitors,
absent herself from the drawing-room at that particular
time, unless the expected visitors are mutual friends of
herself and guest.</p>

<p>If she is in the drawing-room with her guests when a
visitor is announced so as to render an introduction inevitable,
a formal introduction should be made, but the
mistress of the house, after a very few minutes, should make
some excuse, quietly leave the room, and not return until
after the departure of the visitor. It would be inconsiderate
were the mistress of the house to remain in the drawing-room
while calls were paid to her guest by strangers to
herself unless at her guest's particular request. When a
visitor is a gentleman, and the guest a young unmarried
lady, the mistress of the house should remain in the
drawing-room to chaperon her.</p>

<p>When the mistress of the house is desirous of making
the acquaintance of any particular friend of her guest, from
whom she expected a visit, when the visit occurs and previous
to the visitor taking her leave, the guest should ask
if she will allow her to introduce her to the lady with whom
she is staying. If her visitor desires the introduction, she
should then ring and request the servant to tell his mistress
that Mrs. A. is in the drawing-room, which message the
hostess would understand to mean that her presence is
desired, and the introduction would then be made on her
appearing. An introduction, if made in this manner, could
become the basis of a future acquaintance, both ladies
having had the option of refusing the acquaintance of the
other if so disposed; whereas a forced introduction where
no option is given would hardly count as the basis of
a future acquaintance unless the ladies thus introduced
mutually appreciated each other.</p>

<p>In the country a guest seldom has friends and acquaintances
in the neighbourhood, who are unknown to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hostess; if otherwise, the hostess should give her guest
the opportunity of seeing her visitor by leaving them
together when the call is made.</p>

<p>When a guest is present when the mistress of a house
is receiving callers, she should introduce them to her guest
or her guest to them, according to the rank of either
(see <a href="#Page_6">Chapter II.</a>).</p>

<p>When a lady is driving with a friend who is a stranger
to the acquaintance on whom she is calling, she should not
take her into the house with her while she makes her
call, unless she is a young lady, or unless there is some
especial reason for introducing the two ladies to each other,
or unless both ladies have expressed a wish to become
acquainted with each other. Husbands and wives occasionally
pay calls together, but oftener they do not. A lady,
as a rule, pays a call by herself, unless she has a grown-up
daughter, when she should accompany her mother.</p>

<p>Occasionally two ladies, both intimate with the lady
of the house, pay their calls together. A family party, of
father and mother and daughter, or daughters, rarely call in
town together, save under very exceptional circumstances;
but in the country a family party of three or four would,
as a matter of course, call together; it is country etiquette
to do so.</p>

<p>A considerable difference exists with regard to "Sunday
calls," or calling on Sundays. Ladies should not pay
ceremonious calls on Sundays; it would not be etiquette for
an acquaintance to call on a Sunday, it would rather be
considered a liberty, unless she were expressly asked to do
so. Intimate friends, on the contrary, often make Sunday a
special day for calling, and therefore, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;more
especially gentlemen&mdash;extend their calling hours
from three until six o'clock on Sundays.</p>

<p>When a lady is acquainted with the daughters of a
family only, and not with their father or mother, she should
call on the daughters, who should at once introduce her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
their mother on the next occasion of calling. If the mother
is not present, the lady calling should leave cards for her;
and at all morning calls, when the daughters of the house
receive a ceremonious visit from an acquaintance, in the
absence of their mother, whether from indisposition or any
other cause, cards should be left for her in the hall before
leaving by the lady calling (see <a href="#Page_19">Chapter III.</a>).</p>

<p>In all cases, when "morning calls" are made, and the
lady called on is not at home, cards should be left according
to the etiquette described in <a href="#Page_6">Chapter II.</a>, an etiquette
which should be strictly observed; when the lady called
on is "at home," cards should be left for the gentlemen of
the family, according to the same rules of card-leaving,
which cannot be too punctiliously followed.</p>

<p>A mistress of a house should inform her servant after
or before luncheon, or before the hours for calling, whether
she intends to be "at home" to visitors or not during the
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Not at home" is the understood formula expressive
of not wishing to see visitors.</p>

<p>"Not at home" is not intended to imply an untruth, but
rather to signify that for some reason, or reasons, it is not
desirable to see visitors; and as it would be impossible to
explain to acquaintances the why and the wherefore of its
being inconvenient to receive visitors, the formula of "Not
at home" is all-sufficient explanation, provided always that
a servant is able to give a direct answer at once of "Not at
home" when the query is put to him. If a servant is not
sure as to whether his mistress wishes to see visitors or not,
it is almost a direct offence to the lady calling if he hesitates
as to his answer, and leaves her either sitting in her carriage
or standing in the hall, while "He will see if his mistress is
'at home,'" perhaps returning with the unsatisfactory
answer that she is "Not at home"; in which case the
intimation is almost received as a personal exclusion rather
than as a general exclusion of visitors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>If a lady is dressing to go out when a visitor calls, the
servant can mention that fact to a visitor calling, and offer
to ascertain if his mistress will see the caller; and the
caller should use her own discretion as to whether she will
allow him to do so or not; but unless the visit is one of
importance, it would be best in such a case only to leave
cards.</p>

<p>When a second visitor calls, a servant should not be permitted
to say that his mistress is "engaged with a lady," or
"with a gentleman," but should usher the second caller
into the drawing-room, as he has previously done the first
caller. He should not inquire as to whether his mistress
will see the second caller or not. Neither should he inform
the second caller as to whether any one is or is not with his
mistress, as ignorant servants are too apt to do.</p>

<p>It is not usual to offer coffee at afternoon tea; tea only
is given. To offer coffee is a foreign fashion, and not an
English one.</p>

<p>"Morning" callers should not be conducted to the
dining-room to have tea; and tea is only served in the
dining-room on the occasion of a large afternoon tea, or
afternoon "at home," etc. (See chapter on "Afternoon
'At Homes,'" p. <a href="#Page_151">151</a>.)</p>

<p>The tea hour varies from 4 to 4.30 o'clock. When
callers are present at 4 o'clock, tea should be brought in at
that hour. It should be placed upon a small table, which
is first covered with a white linen or damask tea-cloth. The
tea-tray should be large enough to hold, in addition to the
china, silver teapot, etc., an urn for hot water, which should
be brought in and placed upon it. A stand containing hot
cakes, an uncut cake, small cakes, tiny sandwiches, and thin
bread-and-butter should be placed near to the tea-table.
Tiny tea-plates should be placed in a pile upon the tea-tray,
they being in general use. The hostess or her daughter
should pour out the tea.</p>

<p>Apart from the foregoing style of afternoon tea is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
newer fashion of what might be termed "a round-table tea,"
at which hostess and guests sit, but this style is more usual
at country houses than in town houses at present, on account
of the space required, if for no other reason. The tea is
served in a smaller drawing-room, upon a large round or
oval table, which is covered with a white table-cloth, upon
which the tea-tray with all its contents is placed. Cakes,
hot and cold, sandwiches, pastry, fruit, jam, bread-and-butter,
biscuits, dry toast, etc., are given, and the visitors
seated at the table help themselves to what they require.
The hostess pours out the tea and hands the cups as when
guests are not seated in this way. Dessert plates and dessert
knives and forks should be placed on the table beside the
small tea-plates, to be taken as required.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>PRECEDENCY</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> order of precedency due to each individual according
to rank is a matter of great importance at official banquets
and at ceremonious dinner-parties, when its correct observance
should be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards Precedency amongst Royal Personages</big></b>,
the Sovereign takes precedence of all others in the
realm; the King takes precedence of Queen Mary. The
Prince of Wales takes precedence of the Duke of Connaught.
Queen Alexandra takes precedence of the Royal
Princesses. The Royal Princesses take precedence of their
husbands, Prince Christian and the Duke of Argyll.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Precedency accorded to Foreign Royal
Personages</big></b> in this country very much depends upon
their individual rank. Imperial Highnesses and Royal
Highnesses take precedence of Serene Highnesses.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Precedency accorded to Eastern Princes</big></b>
is generally synonymous with that accorded to Serene
Highnesses; but in some instances the claims of individual
precedency are so difficult to define, that in official cases it
is sometimes necessary to make a special rule as to the
amount of precedency to be allowed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards General Precedency</big></b>, archbishops,
ambassadors, The Lord High Chancellor, The Prime
Minister, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lord President of
the Council, and Lord Privy Seal, take precedence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
dukes; dukes take precedence of earls, and so on throughout
the various degrees of nobility.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Foreign Ministers and Envoys</big></b> take precedence
next after dukes, in the order of their seniority of service in
England. In all cases where precedency is to be established
between persons of equal rank it is necessary to refer to a
Peerage for date of creation of title, as this actually decides
all precedency.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For Precedency due to Baronets</big></b> and their wives
a Baronetage should be consulted.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For Precedency due to Knights</big></b> and their wives
a Knightage should be consulted in reference to each order
of knighthood.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For the Precedency due to the Legal Profession</big></b>
a Law List should be consulted when it is not defined
by office or birth.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For the Precedency due to the Clergy</big></b> a Clergy
List should be consulted when superior preferment or birth
does not define it.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For the Precedency due to Officers</big></b> in the army
and navy an Army List and a Navy List should be consulted
to determine the precedency due to each in the
separate Services.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Officers should be sent in to Dinner</big></b> according
to the dates of commission, but no branch of the Army
takes precedence over the other as regards rank of officers;
that is to say, a colonel of 1901, of say, a West India
regiment, would precede a colonel of Guards, artillery or
cavalry of 1902 promotion. Drawn up on a brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
parade, the cavalry take the right of the line; thus:
Artillery, Royal Engineers, foot guards and regular regiments,
regiments and West India regiments, in the order named in
the Army List.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards Precedency between Officers</big></b> of the
combined Services a table of "Relative Rank and Precedency
in the Army and Navy" should be consulted, as a
captain in the navy after three years' service ranks with a
colonel in the army, a lieutenant of the navy of eight
years' standing ranks with a major in the army, and a
lieutenant under that standing in the navy, ranks with a
captain in the army, etc.</p>

<p>Consulate officers also take precedence according to
seniority of service in England and date of official arrival.
The Foreign Office List of the current year should be
consulted for date in each instance.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards the Precedence due to Widows</big></b>
bearing titles who have married again: The widow of a
peer married to a commoner retains her title by courtesy,
and the precedency due to the title is accorded to her.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When the Widow of a Duke</big></b> marries a person of
lower rank than that of her late husband, she still retains
her precedency.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Daughter of a Peer</big></b> if married to a baronet or
a commoner retains her precedency, but if married to a
baron her precedency is merged in that of her husband.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Widow of a Baronet</big></b> married to a commoner
retains her title by right and not by courtesy.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Widow of a Knight</big></b> married to a commoner
retains her title by courtesy only, but the precedency due to
the widow of a knight is accorded to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When the Daughter of a Duke</big></b> marries a peer she
takes the precedency due to the rank of her husband; if
she marries a commoner, precedency is accorded to her
due to the daughter of a duke.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Age confers no Precedency</big></b> on either sex. Equals
in rank from the highest to the lowest take precedence
according to the creation of their title and not as regards
the age of the person bearing the title. As, for instance, a
youthful duke would take precedence of an aged duke, if
the title of the youthful duke bore an earlier date than that
of the aged duke. The same rule applies equally to
baronets and knights.</p>

<p>When two earls are present at a dinner-party, the date
of their respective patents of nobility decides the order of
precedency due to them.</p>

<p>A host or hostess should always consult a "Peerage" or
a "Baronetage" if in doubt as to the precedence due to
expected guests bearing titles; wealth or social position are
not taken into account in this matter, it being strictly a
question of date.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Precedence due to Ladies of Equal Rank</big></b>
takes effect in the same manner. Thus, a young wife
of a baronet takes precedence over the elderly wife of a
baronet if the creation of her husband's title bears an earlier
date.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When the Claims to Precedency of Persons of
Equal Rank</big></b> clash, the claims of a gentleman should be
waived in favour of those of a lady, should the persons be of
opposite sexes. Thus, if two couples of superior rank to the
other guests were present at a dinner-party, the host should
take down the lady of highest rank, and the hostess should
be taken down by the gentleman of highest rank, in which
case the lady second in rank should go in to dinner <i>before</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
her husband, although the gentleman taking her down to
dinner were of lower rank than her husband.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Esquires, and the Wives of Esquires</big></b>, take precedence
according to their social position. Members of
Parliament have no precedence, though it is often accorded
to them as a matter of courtesy, especially in the county
which they represent; the wives of members of Parliament
are likewise entitled to no precedence on the ground of
their husbands being members of Parliament.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The High Sheriff of a County</big></b> takes precedence
over all other gentlemen in the county, of whatever rank,
save the lord-lieutenant, according to the Royal warrant
issued by His late Majesty King Edward, giving precedence
to lord-lieutenants of counties before high
sheriffs.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The High Sheriff</big></b> out of his particular county has no
precedence, neither has a lord-lieutenant; and the wives of
either lords-lieutenants or high sheriffs take no precedence
on account of their husbands' official dignity.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>An Assize Judge</big></b> takes precedence over the high sheriff
as the assize judge represents the Sovereign of the Realm.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Clergymen, Barristers-at-Law</big></b>, officers in the army
and navy take precedence over esquires on account of such
rank; and in each profession precedence should be accorded
them according to dignity, date of ordination, date of call,
and date of commission in their several professions, assuming
that the rank is equal.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>High Clerical and Legal Dignitaries</big></b> take special
precedence; for instance, the Archbishop of Canterbury
takes precedence of all dukes, and the Lord Chancellor takes
precedence of the Archbishop of York, who also takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
precedence of dukes; bishops take precedence of all
barons, whatever their date of creation. The Lord Chief
Justice, the Master of the Rolls, when not peers, and all
judges of the High Court of Justice in their various
divisions, take precedence after Privy Councillors and
before baronets and all knights, save the Knights of the
Garter.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Relative Rank between Officers of the
Army and Navy</big></b> and doctors of divinity is somewhat
difficult to determine as regards the precedence to be given
them at a dinner-party. "Dod" places "esquires by office,
which, of course, includes all officers of the army and navy,"
next <i>before</i> the younger sons of knights and before doctors in
divinity, who follow next in order; while "Lodge" places
"officers of the navy and army" <i>after</i> the younger sons of
knights bachelor, clergymen, and barristers-at-law.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Precedency at Dinner-Parties.</big></b>&mdash;When royalty is
present at a dinner-party, a prince of blood royal takes precedence
of a princess, and leads the way with the hostess,
the host following next with the princess. On the other hand,
a princess of the blood royal takes precedence of a foreign
prince&mdash;her husband&mdash;and leads the way with the host.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Host should take down the Lady of
Highest Rank</big></b>, and lead the way with her to the dining-room.
The guests should follow the host in couples according
to the degree of precedence due to them, and the hostess
should follow the last couple with the gentleman of highest
rank present.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Greater Number of Gentlemen</big></b> than
ladies are present at a dinner-party, as is often the case,
these gentlemen should follow the hostess to the dining-room
and not precede her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Widow or Maiden Lady is Hostess</big></b>,
and there is no gentleman of the family present to act as
host, the gentleman second in rank should take down the
lady of highest rank, leading the way with her to the dining-room,
the hostess following last, with the gentleman of
highest rank.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In the Case of either a Husband's Sister</big></b> or a
wife's sister being required to act as hostess, precedence
should be given to the wife's sister.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>An Eldest Son's Wife</big></b> should take precedence of
her husband's sisters in his father's house.</p>

<p>As regards the precedence due to the relatives of a host
or hostess, it should give way in favour of that due to the
guests not related to the host or hostess, although their
relatives might be, perhaps, of higher rank than the guests
themselves.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the eldest son of the house acts as second
host, taking down a lady second or third in rank; but the
daughters of the house should always be taken down to
dinner after the other ladies present, and in no case before
them.</p>

<p>No precedence is accorded to either a lady or a gentleman
by virtue of a mother's rank.</p>

<p>No precedence is accorded to brides in society, though
occasionally in the country old-fashioned people consider it
due to a bride to send her in to dinner with the host on the
occasion of her first dining at a house within three months
of her marriage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE COLLOQUIAL APPLICATION OF TITLES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> colloquial application of titles differs materially from
the application of titles when not used colloquially, and
many persons are in doubt as to whether they should or
should not make use colloquially of titles in full.</p>

<p>His Majesty the King should be addressed as "Sir" by
all those who come in social contact with him; and by all
others as "Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Her Majesty Queen Mary should be addressed as
"Ma'm" by all those who come in social contact with her;
and by all others as "Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Her Majesty Queen Alexandra should be addressed as
"Ma'm" by all those who come in social contact with her;
and by all others as "Your Majesty."</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, the Duke of Connaught, and all
princes of the blood royal, should be addressed by the
upper classes as "Sir."</p>

<p>The princesses of the blood royal, should be addressed
as "Ma'm" by the upper classes. The wives of the princes
of the blood royal should also be addressed as "Ma'm" by
the upper classes.</p>

<p>All crowned heads visiting England should be addressed
as "Sir" by those socially known to them, and as "Your
Majesty" by all others. The Royal ladies, their wives,
should be addressed as "Ma'm" by those personally known
to them, and as "Your Majesty" by all others.</p>

<p>A foreign prince bearing the title of Serene Highness
should be addressed as "Prince," and not as "Sir," by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
aristocracy and gentry, and as "Your Serene Highness" by
all other classes.</p>

<p>A foreign princess, also bearing the title of serene
highness, should be styled "Princess" when addressed
colloquially by the upper classes, but not as "Ma'am"; and
as "Your Serene Highness" by all other classes.</p>

<p>An English duke should be addressed as "Duke" by
the aristocracy and gentry, and not as "Your Grace" by
members of either of these classes. All other classes should
address him colloquially as "Your Grace."</p>

<p>An English duchess should be addressed as "Duchess"
by all persons conversing with her belonging to the upper
classes, and as "Your Grace" by all other classes.</p>

<p>A marquess, colloquially, should be addressed as "Lord
A."</p>

<p>A marchioness should be addressed as "Lady A." by
the upper classes. It would be a mistake to address an
English marquess as "Marquess," or a marchioness as
"Marchioness," colloquially speaking. All other classes
should address them either as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship,"
"My Lady" or "Your Ladyship."</p>

<p>An earl should be addressed as "Lord B." by the upper
classes, and as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A countess should be addressed as "Lady B." by the
upper classes, and as "My Lady" or "Your Ladyship" by
all other classes.</p>

<p>A viscount should be addressed as "Lord C." by the
upper classes, and as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship" by
all other classes.</p>

<p>A viscountess should be addressed as "Lady C." by
the upper classes, and as "My Lady" or "Your Ladyship"
by all other classes.</p>

<p>A baron should be addressed as "Lord D." by the
upper classes, and as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship" by
all other classes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A baroness should be addressed as "Lady D." by the
upper classes, and as "My Lady" or "Your Ladyship" by
all other classes.</p>

<p>In strictly official or business intercourse a marquess, an
earl, a viscount, a baron, and a younger son of a duke or
marquis, should be addressed as "My Lord."</p>

<p>The eldest son of a duke should be addressed as "Lord
A." by the upper classes, and as "My Lord" or "Your
Lordship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The wife of the eldest son of a duke should be addressed
as "Lady A." by the upper classes, and as "My Lady" or
"Your Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The younger sons of a duke should be addressed as
"Lord John E." or "Lord Charles E." by the upper classes,
and as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship" by all other
classes. Persons well acquainted with them would address
them colloquially by their title and christian name, as
"Lord John" or "Lord Charles." The same remark applies
to their wives, who are often colloquially addressed as
"Lady Alfred" or "Lady Edward."</p>

<p>The wives of the younger sons of a duke should be
addressed as "Lady John E." or "Lady Charles E." by
the upper classes, and as "My Lady" or "Your Ladyship"
by all other classes.</p>

<p>The daughters of a duke should be addressed as "Lady
Mary A." or "Lady Elizabeth B." by the upper classes, and
as "Lady Mary" and "Lady Elizabeth" by those intimate
with them, and as "My Lady" or "Your Ladyship" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>The eldest son of a marquess should be addressed as
"Lord A." by the upper classes, and as "My Lord" or
"Your Lordship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The wife of the eldest son of a marquis should be
addressed as "Lady A." by the upper classes, and as "My
Lady" or "Your Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The younger sons of a marquis should be addressed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"Lord Henry B." and "Lord Frederick B." by the upper
classes, and as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>The wives of the younger sons of a marquis should be
addressed as "Lady Henry B." and "Lady Frederick B."
by the upper classes, and as "My Lady" or "Your
Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The daughters of a marquis should be addressed as
"Lady Florence B." and "Lady Sarah B." by the upper
classes, and as "My Lady" or "Your Ladyship" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>The eldest son of an earl should be addressed as "Lord
C." by the upper classes, and as "My Lord" or "Your
Lordship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The wife of the eldest son of an earl should be addressed
as "Lady C." by the upper classes, and as "My Lady" or
"Your Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The daughters of an earl should be addressed as "Lady
Blanche" and "Lady Evelyn" by the upper classes, and as
"My Lady" or "Your Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The younger sons of earls, and both eldest and younger
sons of viscounts and barons, only bear the courtesy title of
honourable. The daughters of viscounts and barons also
bear the courtesy title of honourable. This title should
never be used colloquially, "The Hon. Cecil Blank," "The
Hon. Mrs. Cecil Blank," and "The Hon. Mary Blank,"
should be styled "Mr., Mrs., and Miss Mary Blank."</p>

<p>Baronets should be addressed by their full title and
surname, as Sir John Blank, by the upper classes, and by
their titles and christian names only by all other classes.</p>

<p>Baronets' wives should be addressed as "Lady B." or
"Lady C," according to the surnames of their husbands:
thus, "Sir John Blank's" wife should be addressed as
"Lady Blank" by the upper classes, not as "Lady John
Blank"&mdash;to do so would be to give her the rank of the wife
of the younger son of a duke or marquis instead of that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a baronet's wife only&mdash;and as "My Lady" or "Your
Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p>The wives of knights should be addressed as "Lady B."
or "Lady C.," according to the surnames of their husbands:
thus, "Sir John Blank's" wife should be addressed as
"Lady Blank" by the upper classes, and as "My Lady" or
"Your Ladyship" by all other classes.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In addressing Foreigners of Rank colloquially</big></b>,
the received rule is to address them by their individual
titles and surnames.</p>

<p>A prince or princess should be addressed by their full
title: thus, "Prince Munich," or "Princess Munich," by the
upper classes. Persons intimate with them usually address
them as "Prince" or "Princess," as the case may be.</p>

<p>In the case of a prince being a younger son, and not the
reigning head of the house, his christian name is generally
used after his title when addressing him: thus, "Prince
Louis," in lieu of "Prince" only. The same remark
applies to the unmarried daughters of princes. They also
should be addressed by their christian name, in addition to
their title of "Princess," by the aristocracy and gentry, and
as "Your Serene" or "Your Imperial Highness," according
to their birth and title, by all other classes.</p>

<p>A French duke should be addressed by his surname,
with the addition of monsieur: thus, "Monsieur de Rouen,"
by the upper classes, and as "Monsieur le Duc" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A French duchess should be addressed by her surname,
with the addition of madame: thus, "Madame de Rouen"
by the upper classes, and as "Madame la Duchesse" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A marquis should be addressed by his surname, with
the addition of monsieur: thus, "Monsieur de Harfleur"
by the upper classes, and as "Monsieur le Marquis" by all
other classes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>A marquise should be addressed by her surname, with
the addition of madame: thus, "Madame la Harfleur" by
the upper classes, and as "Madame la Marquise" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A comte should be addressed by his surname, with the
addition of monsieur: thus, "Monsieur de Montpellier"
by the upper classes, and as "Monsieur le Comte" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A comtesse should be addressed by her surname, with
the addition of madame: thus, "Madame de Montpellier"
by the upper classes, and as "Madame la Comtesse" by
all other classes.</p>

<p>A vicomte should be addressed by his surname, with the
addition of monsieur: thus, "Monsieur de Toulouse" by
the upper classes, and as "Monsieur le Vicomte" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A vicomtesse should be addressed by her surname,
with the addition of madame: thus, "Madame de Toulouse"
by the upper classes, and as "Madame la Vicomtesse" by
all other classes.</p>

<p>A baron should be addressed by his surname, with the
addition of monsieur: thus, "Monsieur d'Avignon" by the
upper classes, and as "Monsieur le Baron" by all other
classes.</p>

<p>A baronne should be addressed by her surname, with
the addition of madame: thus, "Madame d'Avignon" by
the upper classes, and as "Madame la Baronne" by all
other classes.</p>

<p>A young unmarried lady should be addressed as
"Mademoiselle d'Avignon" by the upper classes, and as
"Mademoiselle" by all other classes.</p>

<p>In German titles the distinction of "Von" before the
surname is seldom used colloquially, the title and surname
being used without the prefix of "Von." Thus, "Count
von Ausberg" should be addressed as "Count Ausberg" in
conversation, and not as "Monsieur le Comte."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Foreign ladies of rank should be addressed by their title
and surname, and not by their title only, and the prefix
"Von" should be omitted; but in the case of a French or
Italian title the "de" or "de la" before the surname should
on no account be omitted.</p>

<p>When Englishmen are extremely intimate with foreigners
of rank they would, in conversation, probably address them
by their surnames; but only thorough intimacy and friendship
warrants this familiarity.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards addressing the Clergy</big></b>, an archbishop
should be addressed colloquially as "Archbishop" by the
upper classes, and as "Your Grace" by the clergy and all
other classes.</p>

<p>A bishop should be addressed colloquially as "Bishop"
by the upper classes, and as "My Lord" by the clergy and
all other classes.</p>

<p>A dean should be styled "Dean Blank" or "Dean,"
by the upper classes, and as "Mr. Dean" by the clergy.</p>

<p>An archdeacon should be addressed as "Archdeacon
Blank," and a canon as "Canon Blank."</p>

<p>The wives of archbishops, bishops, and deans should be
respectively addressed as "Mrs. A.," "Mrs. B.," or "Mrs.
C." They take no title from the spiritual rank of their
husbands.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Officers in the Army</big></b> should be respectively addressed
as "General A.," "Colonel B.," "Major C.," or "Captain
D.," and not as "General," "Colonel," or "Major," except
by their very intimate friends.</p>

<p>The wives of officers should be addressed as "Mrs. A.,"
"Mrs. B.," "Mrs. C.," or "Mrs. D." They should never
be addressed as "Mrs. General A.," "Mrs. Colonel B.,"
"Mrs. Major C.," or "Mrs. Captain D."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>A lady should not address her husband colloquially by
his surname only, as "Jones," "Brown," or by whatever
his surname might be, or speak of him without the prefix
of "Mr."</p>

<p>The usual rule is for a wife to speak of her husband as
"Mr. Brown," or "My husband," except to intimate
friends, when the christian name only is frequently used,
and to address him by his christian name only.</p>

<p>A wife should not address her husband by the initial
letter of his surname, as "Mr. B." or "Mr. P."; neither
should a husband address his wife by the initial letter of his
surname.</p>

<p>When intimate friends address each other by the initial
letter of their names it is by way of pleasantry only, and
such cases, of course, do not come within the rules of
etiquette.</p>

<p>Peeresses frequently address their husbands, and speak
of them, by the name attached to their title, in place of
using their christian or family name. Thus, the "Earl
of Blankshire" would be styled "Blankshire" by his wife,
without the prefix of "Lord," and his usual signature would
be "Blankshire," without the addition of any christian
name.</p>

<p>Baronets' wives should not address their husbands by
their surnames, but by their christian names, and should
speak of them as "Sir George" or "Sir John."</p>

<p>The wives of knights also should not address their
husbands by their surnames, but by their christian names,
and should speak of them as "Sir George" or "Sir John."</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor should be addressed as "Lord Mayor,"
colloquially, and the Lady Mayoress as "Lady Mayoress,"
unless the Lord Mayor during office is created a baronet
or receives the honour of knighthood, when he should be
addressed as "Sir John" or "Sir Henry," and his wife as
"Lady A."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>POINTS OF ETIQUETTE AS REGARDS ROYAL PERSONAGES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">General</span> society is now very frequently brought into
contact with royalty&mdash;members of the Royal Family of
England and members of various royal families of Europe.</p>

<p>With His Majesty this association is of frequent occurrence
as regards the general public, and persons possessing
special interest are constantly brought into communication
with him.</p>

<p>Strict Court etiquette is greatly in abeyance, and laid
aside by His Majesty when paying visits to personal friends,
or when receiving visits from the same.</p>

<p>The geniality of the English princes and princesses is
everywhere acknowledged, and the restrictions of Court
etiquette are frequently relaxed by their desire when
visiting at the houses of the nobility and gentry.</p>

<p>The etiquette that reigns in foreign Courts&mdash;Austria,
Russia, Greece, etc.&mdash;is seldom waived, and is adhered to
with much punctilio. So much so is this the case with
certain foreign princes who visit our shores, that the observances
they claim as due to their exalted position are
often felt to be a restraint upon the hosts whom they
honour with their company, in town or country, at dinner,
ball, or country-house party.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many royal personages who occasionally
visit England are unbending and unceremonious
towards society in general.</p>

<p>When royal personages visit London for a few weeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
whether located at palace, embassy, or hotel, it is etiquette
for any person who is personally acquainted with or connected
in any way with their Court or cabinet, or who has
been presented at their Court, to leave cards on them and
write their names in their visiting books. Persons still
higher in the social scale, give receptions in their honour,
and invite them to stay at their princely mansions.</p>

<p>When such visits are paid, the principal neighbours are
usually invited to meet the royal guests at dinner, ball, or
reception, and on the invitation card is written, "To meet
H.R.H. the Crown Prince of &mdash;&mdash;," or "Her Serene Highness
the Grand Duchess of &mdash;&mdash;," etc.; but a hostess
exercises her own discretion respecting the invitations she
issues.</p>

<p>If a ball is in contemplation the county at large is invited
to the mansion, but if dinner invitations only are issued,
then the circle is necessarily restricted to a favoured few.</p>

<p>The neighbours who are not invited to a house where a
royal guest is staying should avoid calling on the hostess
until the departure of the royal visitors, even if calls are due.</p>

<p>The principal people of a county who happen to be
present at an entertainment, either dinner or dance, are
usually presented to the royal guests by the host or hostess,
permission to do so having been first solicited.</p>

<p>When the person to be presented is a person of rank
or distinction, it would only be necessary to say, "May
I present Lord A., or General B., to you, Sir?" but if
the person to be presented has no particular claim to the
honour beyond being popular in the county, the request
should be prefaced with a few words of explanation
respecting the person to be presented.</p>

<p>When the name or fame of those presented has reached
the ears of the royal guests, they usually shake hands on
the presentation being made, and enter into conversation
with them; otherwise they merely bow, and make one or
two passing remarks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>A house-party is generally composed of those with whom
a royal guest is more or less acquainted. When the party
includes any one who is a stranger to the royal guests, he
or she should be presented on the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The members of the Royal Family have each, more or
less, their particular set, as have also the foreign princes
who periodically visit this country, and therefore house-parties
are usually made up of those moving in the set
of the expected prince.</p>

<p>For the proper mode of addressing royal personages,
see <a href="#Page_53">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards royal invitations</big></b>, all invitations from the
Sovereign are commands, and must be answered and obeyed
as such, and the word "command" must be made use of
in answering such invitations. If any reason exists for not
obeying His Majesty's commands it should be stated.</p>

<p>Invitations from members of the Royal Family are
treated by courtesy as commands, but in replying to such
invitations the word "command" should not be used. The
answers to such invitations should be addressed to the Comptroller
of the Household, by whom they are usually issued.</p>

<p>Answers to royal invitations should be written in the
third person, and reasons given for non-acceptance.</p>

<p>A previous engagement cannot be pleaded as an excuse
for refusing a royal invitation; only personal indisposition
or serious illness, or death of near relatives, would be
adequate reasons for not accepting a royal invitation.</p>

<p>When a royal invitation is verbally given, the answer
should be verbal also.</p>

<p>At all entertainments at which royal guests are present
they should be received by the host and hostess in the
entrance-hall. In the case of serene highnesses they
should be received by the host and conducted by him to
the hostess; this rule equally applies to the reception of

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Henceforward there are to be</big></b> in Great Britain no

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>POINTS OF ETIQUETTE WHEN TRAVELLING ABROAD, AND
PRESENTATIONS AT FOREIGN COURTS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> acquaintanceship of foreign residents is of considerable
service to English people purposing to winter abroad,
or to remain for any length of time in a continental
city, as by its means they obtain an entrance into foreign
society. An introduction to the English Ambassador or
Minister at a foreign Court is of still greater service in
this matter.</p>

<p>People of recognised position in society have the privilege
of leaving cards at the English Embassy at any foreign
city in which they intend making a temporary stay.</p>

<p>So thoroughly is the position of English travellers known
to the English Ministry at a foreign Court, that should a
person, who is not received in English society, leave cards
at the English Embassy, they would be at once returned as
an intimation that the acquaintance is declined.</p>

<p>It is erroneous to suppose that by leaving cards upon
foreigners of distinction, an acquaintanceship can be commenced,
for unless introductions have been formally made,
leaving cards is a useless proceeding.</p>

<p>At far-away spots little frequented by the general run of
travellers, and where there are but few, if any, resident
English, travellers requiring advice or assistance from the
English consul, can, without an introduction, call upon him,
nationality being the ground upon which to do this, and if
of equal social standing, they would be received with social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
consideration; if otherwise, all assistance would be given
to them from an official point of view. Many people when
travelling abroad make pleasant acquaintances even without
the help of introductions, the occasion of a meeting being
as it were a semi-introduction in itself.</p>

<p>Such casual acquaintanceships are, however, attended
with certain risks, especially to persons who have been
absent from England some little time, or who when in
England have entered comparatively but little in society,
and who are thus apt to drift unawares into close friendships
with people perhaps well bred and agreeable, although
tabooed at home for some good and sufficient reason.
<i>Contretemps</i> such as these are painful to kind-hearted
people when subsequently compelled to avoid and to
relinquish the acquaintance of those with whom they have
become pleasantly intimate. An introduction to an English
resident in either town or city obviates any unpleasantness
of this nature, as one so situated is generally kept <i>au courant</i>
with all that takes place in society at home.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When persons desire to enter into society abroad</big></b>
they endeavour to obtain letters of introduction from friends
and acquaintances to residents in the cities they purpose
visiting.</p>

<p>Unless English travellers have been duly presented at
the Court of St James's, they cannot obtain presentations at
foreign Courts through the English Embassies.</p>

<p>When a lady desires a presentation at a foreign Court,
she should write to the English Ambassadress and request
the honour of a presentation, and should state the date of
her presentation and the name of the lady by whom she was
presented. After her statement has been duly verified the
request is granted. In a like manner when a gentleman
desires a presentation at a foreign Court, he should write to
the Ambassador and request the honour of a presentation,
and should state the date of the Lev&eacute;e at which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
presented, and the name of the person by whom the
presentation was made.</p>

<p>Presentations at foreign Courts take place in the evening,
and the persons to be presented, and those who attend,
assemble previous to the entrance of the royal personages:
the rule is for the grand <i>ma&icirc;tresse</i> to present each lady in
turn to her royal mistress, who makes the tour of the
apartment for this purpose, and addresses some courteous
observation to each.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE RECEIVED MODE OF PRONOUNCING CERTAIN SURNAMES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> are, perhaps, two reasons why various surnames are
so frequently mispronounced, the one being unfamiliarity
with the freak of fashion which governs the pronunciation
of certain well-known names, the other ignorance, or want
of education.</p>

<p>When sensitive persons hear a name pronounced differently
from the way in which they have themselves but just
pronounced it, and in a tone and manner strongly suggestive
of correction, it is wounding to their <i>amour propre</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule, when persons are in doubt as to the correct
pronunciation of any particular name, it would be best to
avoid mentioning it, if possible, until their doubts are set
at rest by some one better informed than themselves.</p>

<p>Names that have a fashionable or peculiar pronunciation,
or are pronounced otherwise than as they are spelt, are but
few, and names which it is possible wrongly to accent are
also not very numerous; but it is surprising how often these
names occur in the course of conversation.</p>

<p>The names of distinguished artists that are open to mispronunciation
occur far oftener in conversation than do the
general run of uncommon surnames.</p>

<p>There are many celebrated hunts and hunting quarters of
which the names are open to considerable mispronunciation.</p>

<p>With regard to placing the accent on the wrong syllable
in the pronunciation of names, it requires but little
thought to avoid making this mistake, a popular error being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that of placing the accent upon the last syllable of a
name; whereas, in a name of two syllables, the accent
should invariably be placed upon the first, and the second
syllable should be as it were slightly abbreviated or slightly
altered.</p>

<p>In names of three syllables the error usually consists in
placing the accent upon the last syllable, whereas the accent
should be placed upon the second syllable. There are
occasional exceptions to this rule, and the few names given
in this chapter, both as regards their pronunciation and
accentuation, will serve as a useful guide in the pronunciation
of uncommon names.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>PRESENTATIONS AT COURTS AND ATTENDING COURTS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Courts</span> are now held in lieu of Drawing-rooms by Their
Majesties the King and Queen at Buckingham Palace, and
at which Presentations to Their Majesties are made.</p>

<p>These Courts are held in the evenings at ten o'clock,
but the hour at which the company should commence to
arrive is intimated by the Lord Chamberlain in the notice
issued of the Courts to be held.</p>

<p>Two Courts are usually, but not invariably, held before
Easter, and two more after Easter.</p>

<p>Ladies who have been presented at Drawing-rooms
and Courts, held during the last two reigns, do not require
to be again presented to Their Majesties the King and
Queen; thus, ladies who have already been presented
at these Drawing-rooms, and who are desirous of being
invited to one or other of these Courts, and who are
also desirous of making presentations, should send in their
names and the names of those to be presented by them to
the Lord Chamberlain, St. James's Palace, S.W., on
the 1st of January in each year, but not before that
date.</p>

<p>Ladies are also privileged to mention at the same time
when it will be most convenient to them to pay their respects
to Their Majesties. If it should not be convenient for a
lady to attend or be presented at the particular Court to
which she is invited, it will be open to her to make her
excuses to the Lord Chamberlain in writing, when her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
name can, if desired, and if possible, be transferred to
another list.</p>

<p>A lady who makes a presentation to Their Majesties,
must be personally acquainted with and responsible for the
lady she presents. She must herself attend the Court, and
cannot present more than one lady in addition to her
daughter or daughter-in-law. The numbers received at
each Court being necessarily limited, ladies can only receive
occasional invitations. Therefore, those who cannot be
included in the year's list of invitations will receive an
intimation to this effect from the Lord Chamberlain in
answer to their applications to attend.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Persons entitled to be presented at Their
Majesties' Courts</big></b> are the wives and daughters of the
members of the aristocracy, the wives and daughters of
those holding high official appointments in the Government,
the wives and daughters of Members of Parliament,
the county gentry and town gentry, the wives and
daughters of the members of the legal, military, naval,
clerical, medical, and other professions, the wives and
daughters of merchants, bankers, and members of the
Stock Exchange, and persons engaged in commerce on a
large scale.</p>

<p>Although the word "gentry" is thus elastic, and although
persons coming within the category might be fairly entitled
to the privilege of attending Courts, yet it is well understood
that birth, wealth, associations, and position give a
<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for such privilege; as, for instance, the wife
and daughters of an officer in the navy or a line regiment,
whose means are slender, and whose position is obscure,
would not be justified for these reasons in attending a
Court, although the officer himself might attend a lev&eacute;e if
desirous of doing so; and this remark equally applies to
the wives and daughters of clergymen, barristers, and others
similarly situated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Presentations to Their Majesties</big></b> are made
officially by the various foreign ambassadresses, by the
wives of the members of the Cabinet, and by the wives
of other official personages in various departments of the
State, either civil, military, naval, or clerical.</p>

<p>Presentations at each of Their Majesties' Courts are
now limited by royal command.</p>

<p>Presentations to Their Majesties should be made either
by a relative or a friend of the lady presented who has
herself been previously presented.</p>

<p>A lady has the privilege of presenting one lady only at
a Court in addition to her daughter or daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>This restriction does not apply to ladies who, from
official position or other circumstances, are specially privileged
to make presentations to Their Majesties.</p>

<p>When a presentation is not made officially or by a near
relative it is considered a favour on the part of the person
making the presentation towards the person presented.</p>

<p>The responsibility of a presentation rests upon the
person who makes it, both as to the social and moral fitness
of the person presented; therefore, to solicit the favour
of a presentation from a friend is to incur a considerable
obligation, and it is a favour ladies have no hesitation in
refusing unless good reasons exist for granting it.</p>

<p>When presentations are made through official channels
the responsibility rests upon the "office" rather than upon
the person making the presentation; hence presentations so
made have little personal significance to the person making
them.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady having been presented on her Marriage</big></b>
has the privilege of attending, by invitation, any
subsequent Court, but ladies who have no official position
will only be allowed to attend a Court by summons every
third year. On the accession of her husband to any title,
she would again have to be presented, and should she marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a second time another presentation would be necessary to
entitle her to attend one of Their Majesties' Courts.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is the Privilege of the Married Lady to
make Presentations</big></b>, but should any person be presented
whose antecedents or present position renders her
socially unqualified to be presented, the Lord Chamberlain,
on becoming aware of the fact, would at once cancel the
presentation, and officially announce it in the <i>Gazette</i>, and
the person making such presentation would be expected
to tender an apology for so doing.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>An Unmarried Lady does not possess the
Privilege</big></b> of making a presentation, however high her
rank may be. She is not permitted to attend any subsequent
Courts after first presentation until three years have elapsed;
save under exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Four Courts are held during each year at Buckingham
Palace, two before and two after Easter, but due intimation
is given previous to each Court being held by the Lord
Chamberlain through the medium of the official <i>Gazette</i>,
from whence it is copied into the newspapers.</p>

<p>The wives of members of the Cabinet and of the
ambassadors or ministers at the Court of St. James's usually
attend at each Court, and have the privilege of doing so
by reason of the official presentations made by them at
each Court.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is compulsory for a Lady</big></b> making a presentation
to be herself present at the Court at which the presentation
is to be made, though it is not necessary for her to
accompany the person whom she presents, but simply to
attend the same Court.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Lady intends making a Presentation</big></b>
she should, on or after the 1st of January write to the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Chamberlain and inform him of a wish to attend a Court,
and forward the name of the lady to be presented by her.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Ladies are not expected</big></b> to attend Court more
than once in every three years, unless under exceptional
circumstances.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady attending a Court</big></b> may present one lady
in addition to her daughter or daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady presented for the First Time</big></b> can only
present her daughter or daughter-in-law at the Court at
which she is presented.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>No Applications can be received</big></b> from ladies who
wish to be presented. Their names must be forwarded by
the ladies who wish to make the presentations.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Summonses are issued</big></b> about three weeks before the
date of each Court.</p>

<p>Ladies may be accompanied to Court by their husbands
if the latter have been presented, but gentlemen do not
pass before the King and Queen. Ladies are requested to
forward the names of their husbands at the same time as
their own, in order that they may be submitted together, as
once the summons has been issued the amending of a
summons card in order to include a lady's husband can
only be permitted under the most exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Those who have the Privilege of the Entr&eacute;e</big></b>
enter at the gate of the Palace situated outside Buckingham
Gate. Those who possess this privilege are the diplomatic
circle, the Cabinet ministers and their wives, and the
members of the Household. The rooms, two in number,
next to the Presence Chamber, are appropriated to them.
All who have the privilege of the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> are received by
Their Majesties before the general circle, and according to
their individual precedency, and they have also the privilege
of making the first presentations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Lady arrives at the Palace</big></b> she should
leave her wraps in the cloak-room with one of the maids
in attendance. After crossing the Great Hall, she then
makes her way up the Grand Staircase to the Corridor,
where she shows her invitation-card to the page-in-waiting,
and then passes on to one of the saloons.</p>

<p>When a lady arrives early she gains admission to the
saloon next to those reserved for the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>. When she
arrives late she has to take her place in a further room of
the suite according to the number of persons present.</p>

<p>The gentlemen-at-arms stationed at the door of each
room close the gilt barriers when they consider the saloons
are full. Chairs and benches are placed in the corridor
and in these saloons for the accommodation of ladies thus
waiting their turn to enter the Throne-room or Presence
Chamber.</p>

<p>As the ladies quit each room for the Presence Chamber,
others take their places, and the barriers are again closed,
and this is continued until every one has been received.</p>

<p>A lady has to pass through the two <i>entr&eacute;e</i> saloons before
reaching the Picture Gallery.</p>

<p>At the door of the Picture Gallery a lady's train, which
she has hitherto carried on her arm, is let down by two
officials in attendance, and spread out by them with their
wands; she should cross the gallery with her train down to
the Presence Chamber, at the door of which she should give
the card of invitation she has brought with her to the
official stationed there to receive it.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady on being presented</big></b>, curtsys to the King
and curtsys to the Queen. The King bows in return, as
does also the Queen. A lady presented does not kiss the
Queen's hand, as she formerly did. The King does not
shake hands with any present, however high their rank may
be, neither does the Queen shake hands with any present.</p>

<p>A lady on being presented does not now curtsy to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
member of the Royal Family when she has passed Their
Majesties, and leaves the Presence Chamber, stepping
backwards, facing the royal party, until making her exit from
the apartment, when an official places her train on her arm
at the threshold of the doorway.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Lady wishes to attend a Court</big></b>, after
having been duly presented, it is necessary to inform the
Lord Chamberlain of her wish to attend. Summonses are
issued about three weeks before the date of each Court.</p>

<p>Having received a summons to attend a Court she
should take the summons card with her, which she should
show to the page-in-waiting in the corridor, and eventually
hand it to the official stationed at the door of the Presence
Chamber, by whom it is passed on to the Lord Chamberlain,
who announces the name to Their Majesties.</p>

<p>A lady attending a Court curtsys to the King; she also
curtsys to the Queen, but does not curtsy to any other
member of the Royal Family present.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In the General Circle there is no Precedency</big></b>
as to the order in which ladies attending a Court enter the
Presence Chamber. The earliest arrivals are the first to
appear before Their Majesties, without reference to rank
or position; and the same rule applies to ladies who are
presented, or to ladies who make presentations.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Married Lady presented at a Court</big></b> can, at the
same Court, present her daughter or daughter-in-law; but
in this case the one presented by her should enter the
Presence Chamber after her, and not before her.</p>

<p>Although, according to present regulations, the unmarried
daughters of members of the nobility and gentry who have
already been presented are only expected to attend a Court
once in every three years, it will not prevent their being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
invited to Court functions, to the State balls, concerts, and
garden parties.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Ladies who have been presented at a Court</big></b>
have the privilege of writing their names in Their Majesties'
visiting book at Buckingham Palace once during the season.
The hours of calling for this purpose are generally from
three to five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is Imperative for Ladies to wear Full Court
Dress</big></b> when attending or being presented at a Court, viz.
low bodice, short sleeves, and train to dress not less than
three yards in length from the shoulders.</p>

<p>Whether the train is cut round or square is a matter
of inclination or fashion. The width at the end should be
54 inches.</p>

<p>It is also imperative that a presentation-dress should be
white, if the person presented be an unmarried lady; and
it is also the fashion for married ladies to wear white on
their presentation, unless their age renders their doing so
unsuitable.</p>

<p>The white dresses worn by either <i>d&eacute;butantes</i> or married
ladies may be trimmed with either coloured or white flowers,
according to individual taste.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>High Court Dress.</big></b>&mdash;The Queen has been pleased to
permit that a high Court dress of silk, satin, or velvet, may
be worn at Their Majesties' Courts, and on other State
occasions, by ladies, to whom, from illness, infirmity, or
advancing age, the present low Court dress is inappropriate,
viz.: Bodices in front, cut square, or heart-shaped, which
may be filled in with white only, either transparent or
lined; at the back, high, or cut down three-quarters height.
Sleeves to elbow, either thick or transparent.</p>

<p>Trains, gloves, and feathers as usual.</p>

<p>It is necessary for ladies who wish to appear in "High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Court Dress" to obtain Royal permission, through the
Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p>This regulation does not apply to ladies who have
already received permission to wear high dress.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>White gloves only should be worn</big></b>, excepting in
case of mourning, when black or grey gloves are admissible.</p>

<p>As a lady on presentation does not now kiss the Queen's
hand as formerly she did, she is not required to remove the
right-hand glove before entering the Presence Chamber.
This order, therefore, is no longer in force, and a lady
wearing elbow gloves and bracelets will find it a great
convenience not to be obliged to take off her glove.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is compulsory for both Married and Unmarried
Ladies to Wear Plumes.</big></b>&mdash;The married
lady's Court plume consists of three white feathers.</p>

<p>An unmarried lady's of two white feathers.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The three white feathers</big></b> should be mounted as a
Prince of Wales' plume, and worn towards the left-hand side
of the head.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Coloured feathers</big></b> may not be worn.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In deep mourning</big></b> white feathers must be worn,
black feathers are inadmissible.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>White veils or lace lappets</big></b> must be worn with the
feathers. The veils should not be longer than 45 inches.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Bouquets are not included</big></b> in the dress regulations
issued by the Lord Chamberlain, although they are invariably
carried by both married and unmarried ladies. It is
thus optional to carry a bouquet or not, and some elderly
ladies carry much smaller bouquets than do younger ladies.</p>

<p>A fan and a lace pocket-handkerchief are also carried
by a lady on presentation or on attending a Court, but
these two items are also altogether optional.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>PRESENTATIONS AT LEV&Eacute;ES AND ATTENDING LEV&Eacute;ES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Lev&eacute;es are held by the King</big></b> in person. Those who
have been presented at lev&eacute;es held by His late Majesty,
King Edward, do not require to be again presented to His
Majesty King George.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Four or more Lev&eacute;es are usually held every
year</big></b> by the King at St. James's Palace.</p>

<p>Gentlemen are officially presented by the heads of any
department or profession to which they individually belong,
whether civil or military, naval or clerical; it is more usual
for a gentleman to be presented by the head of his department,
or by the colonel of his regiment, than by his nearest
relative.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Presentations are also made by Relatives</big></b> and
friends of those presented; but these are greatly in the
minority at all lev&eacute;es.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gentlemen must be again presented</big></b> at every
step in their career, whether civil, military, naval, or clerical&mdash;on
civil appointments, on gaining steps of naval, military,
legal, or clerical rank, and on accession to title, whether
inherited or conferred.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Those entitled to be presented at His Majesty's
Lev&eacute;es are</big></b> the members of the aristocracy and gentry,
the members of the diplomatic corps, the Cabinet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
all leading Government officials, Members of Parliament,
leading members of the legal profession, the naval and
military professions, the leading members of the clerical
profession, the leading members of the medical and artistic
professions, the leading bankers, merchants, and members
of the Stock Exchange, and persons engaged in commerce
on a large scale. An exception to the rule as regards
retail trade is made in favour of any person receiving
Knighthood, or when holding the office of Mayor, or being
made a Justice of the Peace, or on receiving a Commission
in the Territorial forces.</p>

<p>The dates on which lev&eacute;es are to be held are duly
announced in the <i>Gazette</i>, and in the daily newspapers.</p>

<p>At all future lev&eacute;es cards of admission will be required,
as the numbers at each of these ceremonies must be limited.</p>

<p>The Lord Chamberlain has issued the following revised
list of rules, which are to be observed at attendances and
presentations in future&mdash;</p>

<p>All officers, whether on the active or retired lists, of the
Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, of whatever rank,
should communicate with and obtain their cards from the
private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty. All
civil officers of the Admiralty should follow the same rule.</p>

<p>All officers, whether on the active or retired lists, of
the Army, Regulars or Territorials, of whatever rank,
except those on the Indian and Colonial Establishments,
should communicate with and obtain their cards from the
Adjutant-General at the War Office, stating clearly at which
lev&eacute;e they desire to be present, and whether they wish to
attend or to be presented; if the latter, stating by whom
and on what occasion. Deputy lieutenants of counties
should also communicate and obtain their cards from the
War Office.</p>

<p>Officers of the Household Cavalry and Foot Guards on
the active list should make application to the Lord Chamberlain
at St. James's Palace for cards of admission and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
presentation. All retired Officers of the Household Cavalry
and Brigade of Guards should apply to the War Office.</p>

<p>All officers of the Indian Civil Service and of the Indian
Army, of whatever rank, whether on the active or retired
lists, should communicate with and obtain their cards from
the private secretary to the Secretary of State at the India
Office, Whitehall.</p>

<p>All officers of the Colonial service and Colonial forces,
of whatever rank, whether on the active or retired lists,
should communicate with and obtain their cards from the
Colonial Office, Whitehall.</p>

<p>Similarly, all gentlemen connected with the Foreign
Office, the Home Office, officials connected with the Houses
of Parliament, or any Government department, should communicate
with and obtain their cards for attendance or presentation
at lev&eacute;es from the department under which they serve.</p>

<p>Judges, law officers, King's Counsel, and all legal officials
holding appointments under the Crown are requested to
make their applications through the secretary to the Lord
Chancellor.</p>

<p>Peers, bishops, Lords-Lieutenants of Counties, Members
of Parliament, clergy of all denominations, and all gentlemen,
other than the above-mentioned, should communicate
with the Lord Chamberlain at St. James's Palace, when
they will each be furnished with a card of admission for use
at the lev&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The names both for attendance and presentation must
be received at the various offices above indicated not later
than eight days prior to the date of each lev&eacute;e, but in the
case of officers, who make application to the War Office,
fourteen days before the date of each lev&eacute;e.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Gentleman makes a Presentation</big></b> it is
compulsory for him to attend the same lev&eacute;e as the person
whom he presents, and the card of presentation is sent to
him to be forwarded to the person to be presented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Gentleman on being presented</big></b> should bow to
the King, and His Majesty will bow to him in return.
Gentlemen attending a lev&eacute;e should also bow to His Majesty.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gentlemen who have been presented</big></b> at a lev&eacute;e
have the privilege of writing their names in His Majesty's
visiting book at Buckingham Palace once during the season.
The hours of calling for this purpose are generally from
three to five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Dress to be worn at Courts, State
Functions and Lev&eacute;es.</big></b>&mdash;Full dress uniform is invariably
worn by all gentlemen entitled to wear it. All officers of
Scottish kilted corps should wear the kilt irrespective of
their being mounted officers or not. Gentlemen who do
not wear uniform may wear either velvet Court dress,
new style; velvet Court dress, old style; cloth Court
dress.</p>

<p>The new style velvet Court dress is of black silk velvet.
The body of the coat lined with white silk and the skirt
with black silk. Steel buttons. Waistcoat of white satin
or black silk velvet. Breeches of black silk velvet, black
silk hose, patent leather shoes, steel buckled; white bow
necktie, white gloves, sword, black beaver or silk cocked
hat. The velvet Court dress, old style, is very similar to
the foregoing, with the addition of a black silk wig-bag at
the back of the neck, and lace frills and ruffles. The cloth
Court dress consists of a coat of dark mulberry, claret, or
green cloth with black silk linings, gold embroidery on
collar, cuffs, and pocket flaps, gilt buttons with Imperial
Crown; waistcoat of white corded silk or white Marcella;
breeches of cloth, colour of coat; black silk hose, patent
leather shoes, sword, white bow necktie, white gloves, black
beaver or silk cocked hat.</p>

<p>Lev&eacute;e dress is identical with the foregoing except that
trousers&mdash;with a row of narrow gold lace down the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
seams&mdash;are worn, and not breeches. Military patent leather
boots.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Archbishops and Bishops</big></b> at Lev&eacute;es and Courts
wear Convocation robes, viz. scarlet cloth chimere, without
hood; purple cassock and sash, lawn rochet with sleeves,
white cambric bands, black silk scarf, black breeches, silver
knee buckles, black silk stockings, shoes with silver buckles;
purple or black velvet square soft cap to be carried. At
Evening State Functions and Full Dress Dinners they wear
a purple cloth Court coat over a short cassock or apron,
sash of purple silk, black breeches, black silk stockings,
shoes with silver buckles; black corded silk three-cornered
hat to be carried.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Deans and Archdeacons</big></b> at Evening State Functions
wear the same dress as bishops except that the coat and
short cassock are black. Doctors of Divinity at Lev&eacute;es
and Courts wear the scarlet cloth robe of their University,
without hood.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Clergy if not Doctors of Divinity</big></b> at Lev&eacute;es and
Courts wear full canonicals, that is, a black silk Geneva
gown, double-breasted; black silk long cassock and sash,
scarf and white lawn bands, black breeches, silver knee
buckles, black silk stockings, shoes with silver buckles,
black corded silk three-cornered hat. At Full Dress
Dinners and Evening State Parties when canonicals are
not worn, they wear a black cloth Court coat, cassock,
waistcoat of black corded silk, black breeches, black silk
stockings, shoes, silver buckles; black corded silk three-cornered
hat to be carried. White gloves are worn at all
Court functions. The academical habit should not be
worn at Court except when addresses are presented from
the Universities.</p>

<p>When the Court is in mourning, gentlemen attending a
lev&eacute;e are expected to wear a band of black crape on the
left arm above the elbow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>BALLS AND STATE BALLS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Balls</big></b> are given in town and country by society at large, and
these invitation balls include Hunt Balls, Military and Naval
Balls, Yeomanry and Territorial Balls, Bachelors' Balls, etc.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Public Balls</big></b> are those balls for which tickets of
admission can be purchased, although for many of these
balls it is necessary to obtain vouchers from the committees
or patronesses, when held in town or at watering-places.</p>

<p>Public balls include County Balls, Charity Balls, and
Subscription Balls, etc.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In Town, Ball-giving</big></b> is in a way a science, and an
amusement upon which large sums of money are frequently
expended.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Crowded Ball</big></b> is not always pronounced a good ball
by the guests, often the contrary, but then, again, what is
termed a thin ball is open to the accusation of not going
off well, and falling rather flat; of not being kept up with
spirit, and of being considered a stupid ball, and so on.</p>

<p>To hit upon a happy medium with regard to the number
of guests is an achievement in ball-giving which is only
arrived at by a careful study of the map of the county,
and a judicious selection of night. This selection is of
paramount importance to the success of a ball, as when
a smarter ball is given at a smarter house on the particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
evening chosen by the giver of a less brilliant ball, the
grander ball extinguishes the lesser ball, through the most
fashionable people merely looking in at the one, and remaining
the rest of the evening at the other. This putting out
as it were of the lesser light, occurs very frequently during
the London season to ball-givers moving in the same sets.
The guests who have been expected to add lustre to the
lesser balls appear but for a few minutes, and usually arrive
rather early, uncomplimentarily early, at perhaps a little
before eleven, and remain hardly half an hour in the rooms,
making their way to another ball of the same calibre, and
remaining there perhaps another twenty minutes, before
arriving at the goal, viz. <i>the</i> ball of the evening. Both
ladies and gentlemen follow this practice, thus, at a little
after twelve, an average ball-giver finds her rooms deserted
by all but those who have nowhere else to go. Although
the flitting of the guests thus early is a disappointment to
the hostess, and although it does not prevent the fleeting
ball-givers from making suitable returns by placing the
family on their ball lists, it yet greatly mars the enjoyment
of the ball, and prevents its being looked back upon with
anything approaching to pleasure or satisfaction, the departure
of the most eligible partners being not the least of
the vexations of the night.</p>

<p>These <i>contretemps</i> are sometimes unavoidable; but, when
practicable, it is always best to postpone a ball rather than
to allow it to clash with a ball of greater pretensions.</p>

<p>An impromptu dance is often a great success, while an
impromptu ball is almost as certain to prove a great failure.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Difference between a Dance and a Ball</big></b> consists
in the number of the invitations issued, in the strength
of the band, and the extent of the supper arrangements.</p>

<p>At a dance the number of the guests varies from eighty
to two hundred; at a ball they vary from two hundred to
five hundred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>At a dance a piano band is frequently engaged, while at
a ball a full band is requisite. At a ball the floral decorations
are a great feature, at a small dance they are often
dispensed with. Ladies new to society as it were, or whose
circle of acquaintance is of a limited character, and who do
not number in that circle many ball-givers, and who yet
desire to form a ball acquaintance, frequently place their
ball in the hands of some intimate friend of higher standing
than themselves, giving her <i>carte blanche</i> to form a ball list.
When this plan is followed, invitations are still sent out by
the ball-giver; in every case the name and compliments of
the lady who forms the list are sent with the card.</p>

<p>This plan, although of advantage to the hostess, is often
productive of much unpleasantness to her unfashionable
friends, who are naturally very much affronted at being
excluded from the ball list, which they usually are, as a lady
who undertakes to form a ball list for a friend is not a little
arbitrary as to the conditions under which she assumes its
management. She naturally wishes the ball to be confined
to her own set, to the exclusion of what she terms all outsiders.</p>

<p>Ladies are always more or less reluctant to yield up their
ball to the exclusion of their old friends, however anxious
they may be to make new ones. But when a ball is thus
given it is thoroughly understood that conditions, however
stringent, must be complied with.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Hostess should receive her Guests</big></b> at the head
of the staircase at a ball given in town, and at the door of
the ball-room at a country house ball. She should shake
hands with each guest in the order of their arrival.</p>

<p>The ladies of a party should advance towards the hostess,
followed by the gentlemen of their party.</p>

<p>A lady and gentleman should not ascend the staircase
arm-in-arm, or make their entrance into the ball-room arm-in-arm.
The gentlemen invariably enter the ball-room
after the ladies of their party, and never before them, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
arm-in-arm with them. A ball is usually opened either by
the hostess herself, or by one of her daughters.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Opening a Fancy Dress Ball</big></b> simply signifies dancing
in the first quadrille. Opening a dance means dancing
the first valse.</p>

<p>When a member of the Royal Family, or a foreign
prince, is expected, dancing should not commence until the
arrival of the royal guest; and when the royal guest is a lady,
the host should open the ball with her, having his wife or
daughter as <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>. When the royal guest is a prince, the
hostess or her daughter should open the ball with him.</p>

<p>When a prince wishes to dance with any lady present,
with whom he is unacquainted, his equerry informs her of
the prince's intention, and conducts her to the prince,
saying as he does so, "Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;, your Royal Highness"
or "Miss B&mdash;&mdash;, your Royal Highness." The prince
bows and offers her his arm; the lady should curtsy and
take it. She should not address him until addressed by
him, it not being considered etiquette to do so. The same
course is followed by a princess; strangers to the princess
should not ask her to dance, but the host has the privilege
of doing so. When more than one royal personage is
present, the one of the highest rank leads the way, with
either hostess or host. (See <a href="#Page_44">Chapter V.</a>)</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Royal Guests</big></b> should be received by the host and
hostess at the entrance of the mansion, and by them
conducted to the ball-room. At ball-suppers the same
precedence is strictly in force, the royal guests leading the
way with host or hostess (see p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>).</p>

<p>The same etiquette should be observed on the departure
of royal guests as on their arrival.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>General Introductions</big></b> should not be made to royal
guests, and introductions should be made by request only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Gentlemen present at a ball are expected to ask the
daughters of the house for one dance at least.</p>

<p>A hostess should use her own discretion as to any
introduction she thinks proper to make. When a ball is
given in the country, the hostess should endeavour to
find partners for those young ladies who are strangers
to the general company. But when a ball is given in
town, she is not expected to do so, as in town the
guests are supposed to be acquainted with each other
more or less, and to be independent of the kind offices
of a hostess.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Dances mainly in vogue at the moment</big></b> are,
"Valses," "The Boston," "Two Steps," and "The Cotillon,"
in which handsome presents are given. "Quadrilles"
are danced at "State Balls," and at those balls at which
the King and Queen are present. Also at "Fancy Dress
Balls." "Lancers" are danced occasionally at "Hunt
Balls."</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Precedency observed</big></b> in sending guests in to
supper is far more punctiliously followed in the country
than in town. The host should take in the lady of highest
rank present, and the hostess should endeavour to send in
the principal guests according to their individual rank;
but in town she generally leaves the guests to follow the
host and lady of highest rank according to their inclinations,
a guest should not enter the supper-room before the host
has done so.</p>

<p>When a gentleman takes a lady in to supper, he should
re-conduct her to the ball-room as a matter of course; the
fact of friends joining her in the supper-room would not
relieve him from this obligation. And the same etiquette
applies equally to a lady. She should return to the ball-room
only with the gentleman who has taken her down
to supper, unless she is engaged for the ensuing dance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
when her partner might come in quest of her; she should
then return to the ball-room with him.</p>

<p>It is not usual for guests to take leave of a hostess at a
London ball. This remark applies to acquaintances of the
hostess, and not to intimate friends.</p>

<p>At a country ball the guests are on a more friendly
footing than is generally the case in town; and, therefore,
make a point of taking leave of the hostess if possible.</p>

<p>It is optional whether a host conducts a lady to her
carriage or not. In the country more is expected of him
than in town in this respect, as at a London ball, such a
civility would involve a vast amount of exertion which few
hosts would be willing to undergo: ladies accompanied by
an acquaintance generally make their way to their carriages.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Custom of covering in Small Balconies</big></b> and
the windows of the drawing-rooms where a ball takes place,
rendering the atmosphere of the room almost insupportable
from the total exclusion of air, is fast disappearing. The
space gained by this means for the accommodation of the
guests is totally disproportionate to the discomfort thereby
entailed upon them.</p>

<p>Ball-givers have at length realised the mistake of
crowding two hundred to three hundred people together
into rooms not properly ventilated, and it is now the rule,
when covering in balconies, to introduce window frames
into the bunting covering, and to drape them with lace
curtains, etc., the windows of the ball-room being entirely
removed.</p>

<p>Large blocks of ice are frequently placed in convenient
spots for the purpose of cooling the atmosphere, and
coloured ice produces a pretty effect.</p>

<p>Patent ventilators are also much in use, and the substitution
of electric lighting, on account of its emitting little
heat, has become general.</p>

<p>Ball-goers appreciate these alterations as only those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
have experienced the close, stifling atmosphere of an over-crowded
ball-room can do, and as half the London ball-rooms
are only average-sized drawing-rooms, the absurdity
of excluding air from the ball-room with yards of thick
canvas cannot be too severely criticised.</p>

<p>Ball-givers, too, frequently issue far more invitations
than the size of their rooms authorises, under the mistaken
idea that to have a great crowd in their rooms is to give
a good ball.</p>

<p>But experienced ball-givers limit the number of their
invitations to under two hundred, instead of expanding it
to over three hundred.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Country Ball Season</big></b> ostensibly commences in
November, reaches its zenith in January, and terminates
early in February.</p>

<p>The stewards of these balls are, as a rule, the representatives
of the various classes by whom they are attended;
the members of the aristocracy residing in the county
heading the list of stewards, and the members of the
professional classes usually closing it.</p>

<p>The top of the ball-room is, as a rule, appropriated
by the aristocratic element, head stewards and "lady
patronesses."</p>

<p>The enjoyment derived from country balls depends
upon a variety of circumstances, which do not influence in
a like degree the ball-going world of London.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>County Balls</big></b> are principally composed of a series of
large parties brought by different ladies in the neighbourhood
where the ball is held; but there are two classes of
county balls, balls which are held in large and populous
towns and attended by the principal residents of the towns,
with only a small sprinkling of the county aristocracy and
county gentry.</p>

<p>There are also Hunt Balls and annual Charity Balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
which take place between October and February, and which
are an amalgamation of both classes of balls.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood where a ball is held is a sufficient
indication as to whether it is likely to be a smart one or not.</p>

<p>As a rule the leading ladies of a county lend their names
as patronesses and supporters of a charity ball, although it
by no means follows that they will personally attend it; but
a long list of influential patronesses materially increases the
sale of tickets, which is the result to be achieved.</p>

<p>A large attendance is not the primary object of a county
ball, as the sum raised by the sale of tickets is only required
to defray the expenses of the ball, although these are sometimes
considerable, especially when the decorations are
elaborate, and the arrangements on a grand scale, in which
case there is not seldom a deficiency rather than a surplus,
which deficiency is defrayed by the stewards themselves.</p>

<p>To ensure a good ball considerable unanimity on the
part of the county ladies is demanded, and they usually
meet and consult together previous to fixing the date of the
ball, to take into consideration the fixtures of neighbouring
county balls, and so avoid the possibility of the said balls
clashing with their own county ball, and also with a view of
perhaps attracting the house parties of their more distant
neighbours to swell the numbers at their own ball.</p>

<p>House parties invited for a ball vary from ten to twenty-five,
as the accommodation of a house admits.</p>

<p>It is not the province of the stewards of a ball to find
partners for either ladies or gentlemen, and therefore, if a
lady does not form one of a large party, but merely attends
a county ball with a relative or friend, and has not a large
acquaintance amongst these present, she has very little
chance of obtaining partners.</p>

<p>Young ladies do not now return to their chaperons after
each dance, or after they have been to the tea-room.</p>

<p>A gentleman should offer his arm to his partner at the
conclusion of a dance to conduct her to the tea-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
In round dances, it is customary to take frequent pauses,
and not to race round the ball-room until the music
ceases.</p>

<p>At country balls programmes are invariably used; at
London balls they are never used, save at public balls.</p>

<p>County balls usually commence between nine and ten
o'clock, sometimes a ball is not opened until the most
influential of the stewards and their parties have arrived,
but oftener than not the two first dances are over before the
arrival of the county magnates.</p>

<p>It depends upon the length of the drive at what time
people arrive at a ball; as a rule, they do not arrive later
than 10.30 p.m.</p>

<p>The usual mode of conveying a house-party to a ball is
by private omnibus in addition to carriages and motor-cars;
but when these are hired for the occasion the expense
should be defrayed by the guests themselves.</p>

<p>It is usual to leave a country ball not later than half-past
two; the most fashionable people invariably do so
about that hour.</p>

<p>As a matter of course persons attending public balls take
their ball tickets with them.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When attending a Military Ball</big></b>, or a Hunt Ball,
it is usually the rule to take the invitation card and hand it
to the sergeant or official in attendance.</p>

<p>It is sometimes stated on the invitation card that this
is to be done, although it is often taken for granted that
persons will do so of their own accord.</p>

<p>At balls given by private individuals, the invited guests
should not bring their invitation cards with them, unless in
the case of a <i>bal masqu&eacute;</i>, where they are sometimes requested
to do so.</p>

<p>In giving a ball three weeks' notice is considered necessary,
but with regard to a dance a short ten days' notice
would suffice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Invitation Card</big></b> is the usual "at home" card,
the word "Dancing" being printed in the corner of the
card.</p>

<p>The word "ball" should never be used on an invitation
card, however grand the entertainment; and the same form
of invitation is employed either in the case of a small dance
or of a large ball, though in the event of a small dance only
being given, the words "Small" or "Early" should be
written or printed on the invitation card.</p>

<p>Invitations to a ball should be issued in the name of the
hostess only.</p>

<p>When the host is a widower, with a grown-up daughter,
the invitations should be issued in their joint names.</p>

<p>When the host is a widower, or a bachelor, they should
be issued in his name.</p>

<p>Invitations issued by officers, members of hunt committees,
bachelors, etc., to their balls, either request the
pleasure or the honour of Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s company; but this
formula should not be used by ladies when issuing invitations;
the "at home" card should simply bear the word
"Dancing" on the bottom of the card, the hour and date
filled in in the allotted space, the name of the guest written
at the top of the card.</p>

<p>In the case of a written invitation, it would be correct
to use the words "ball" or "dance" when alluding to the
entertainment about to be given, in a friendly note.</p>

<p>A lady or gentleman might ask for an invitation for his
or her friend to a ball given by an acquaintance, although
the acquaintanceship were of a slight character; but a lady
or gentleman should not ask for an invitation to a ball if
unacquainted with the giver of it. The fact of mutual friends
having received invitations to a ball gives no claim upon
the hospitality of a stranger, therefore such requests are
inadmissible.</p>

<p>The proper course for a person to pursue in the event of
desiring an invitation to a ball given by some one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
whom he or she is unacquainted, is to request some mutual
friend to obtain one; and this course is always followed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Cards should be left</big></b> by the guests present at a ball
within the current week if possible. (See <a href="#Page_19">Chapter III.</a>)</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gratuities</big></b> should never be given by the guests to the
servants of the house where a ball is given.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>State Balls.</big></b>&mdash;Two State Balls are annually given at
Buckingham Palace during the London season by command
of His Majesty. Invitations are issued by the Lord
Chamberlain, but His Majesty previously revises the list.</p>

<p>When ladies and gentlemen attend a State Ball at
Buckingham Palace they make their way to the ball-room
<i>unannounced</i>; and there is no official reception accorded to
them, either by "Royalty" or by the Lord Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Dancing does not commence until the arrival of the royal
party, when the guests rise and remain standing while the
Royal Quadrille&mdash;with which the ball opens&mdash;is being danced.</p>

<p>The King and Queen act as host and hostess on these
occasions, but confine their attentions to those with whom
they are personally acquainted.</p>

<p>Ladies attending a State Ball at Buckingham Palace
should wear the usual full evening dress; but they should
not wear Court trains, or plumes, or lappets.</p>

<p>Gentlemen attending State Balls should wear uniform
or full Court dress&mdash;dress coat, breeches and silk stockings,
shoes and buckles; trousers can only be worn as part of a
uniform, and not with a Court dress as generally worn at
a lev&eacute;e.</p>

<p>A gentleman intending to dance should remove his
sword, otherwise he should not do so.</p>

<p>When the Court is in mourning, ladies attending a State
Ball should wear mourning according to the official notice
which duly appears in the <i>Gazette</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Gentlemen should wear crape on the left arm, which is
supplied in the cloak-room of the Palace to those who have
forgotten to provide themselves with it, as it is imperative,
when the Court is in mourning, that a band of crape should
be worn at either State Ball or State Concert.</p>

<p>The balls given by the princes and princesses of the
blood royal are not State Balls, therefore Court dress is not
worn by the gentlemen present.</p>

<p>They act as host and hostess at the balls given by them

are announced.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen do not take their cards of invitation

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>DINNER GIVING AND DINING OUT</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Dinner</big></b> giving is perhaps the most important of all social
observances, therefore dinner-parties rank first amongst all
entertainments.</p>

<p>Dinner giving is so thoroughly understood to rest upon
the principle of an equivalent, that those who do not give
dinners hardly come within the category of diners out. This
rule, however, is open to many exceptions in favour of
privileged individuals, popular and prominent members of
society whose presence at dinner-parties is appreciated and
welcomed in most circles.</p>

<p>Dinner-parties are of more frequent occurrence, and
are of more social significance, than any other form of
entertainment.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Dinner Invitations.</big></b>&mdash;An invitation to dinner conveys
a greater mark of esteem, or friendship and cordiality,
towards the guest invited, than is conveyed by an invitation
to any other social gathering, it being the highest compliment,
socially speaking, that is offered by one person to
another. It is also a civility that can be readily interchanged,
which in itself gives it an advantage over all other
civilities.</p>

<p>The orthodox dinner giver must necessarily possess a
certain amount of wealth, and wealth and wit do not always
go hand in hand. Oftener than not, the former rather
overweights the latter; hence, the introduction of a lighter
element in the form of amusing people whose <i>m&eacute;tier</i> in life
it is to be amusing and to appear amused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner giving is in itself not only a test of the position
occupied in society by the dinner giver, but it is also a
direct road to obtaining a recognised place in society. A
means of enlarging a limited acquaintance and a reputation
for giving good dinners is in itself a passport to fashionable
society. Dinner giving, in the fullest sense of the word, is
a science not easily acquired, so much depending on the
talent which the host or hostess may possess for organising
dinner-parties.</p>

<p>When a large dinner-party is contemplated, it is usual
to give three weeks' notice, but of late this notice has been
extended to four, five, and even six weeks.</p>

<p>Diners out are rather inclined to rebel against this
innovation, considering that an invitation bearing the date
of a month hence pledges them to remain in town, and
as it were controls their movements, for the acceptance
of an invitation is in the eyes of diners out a binding
obligation; only ill-health, family bereavement, or some
all-important reason justifies its being set on one side or
otherwise evaded.</p>

<p>Those inconsiderate enough to make trivial excuses at
the last moment are not often retained on the dinner-list
of a host or hostess.</p>

<p>Dinner invitations are issued in the joint names of host
and hostess.</p>

<p>The master of the house occupies a prominent position
amongst his guests, when dispensing hospitality as a
"dinner giver."</p>

<p>From five to ten days' notice is considered sufficient for
invitations to small and unceremonious dinner-parties.</p>

<p>Printed cards are in general use in town for issuing
dinner invitations, and can be purchased from any stationer;
these cards only require to be filled in with the names of
host and hostess and guests, date, hour, and address. The
united names of the host and hostess should be written in
the space left for that purpose. Thus, "Mr. and Mrs. A.,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and the name or names of the guests in the next vacant
space.</p>

<p>When invitations are issued for small dinner-parties, it is
more usual to write notes than to make use of printed cards.</p>

<p>Acceptances or refusals of dinner invitations should be
sent with as little delay as possible after the invitations
have been received. It is a want of courtesy on the part of
a person invited not to do so, as a hostess is otherwise left
in doubt as to whether the person invited intends dining
with her or not, and is consequently unable to fill up the
vacant place with an eligible substitute; thus rendering her
dinner-party an ill-assorted one.</p>

<p>An answer to an invitation cannot be solicited in a
subsequent note; it is therefore incumbent upon the invited
person to dispatch an answer within a day or two at least.
Dinner invitations are either sent by post or by a servant,
and the answers are also conveyed in a like manner.</p>

<p>Dinner invitations are invariably sent out by the hostess.</p>

<p>It is not usual in town to invite more than three members
of one family; it is now the custom to ask young ladies
with their parents to dinner-parties.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Receiving Dinner-Guests.</big></b>&mdash;The guests should
arrive within fifteen minutes of the hour named on the
invitation card.</p>

<p>On no occasion is punctuality more imperative than in
the case of dining out; formerly many allowed themselves
great latitude in this respect, and a long wait for the tardy
guests was the result. A host and hostess frequently waited
over half an hour for expected guests. But now punctuality
has become the rule in the highest circles, and dinner is
served within twenty minutes of the arrival of the first
guest. In general, people much given to dining out make
a point of arriving in good time; but there are many in
society who presume upon their position, and are proverbially
unpunctual, knowing that in the height of the season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
a hostess would wait half an hour rather than sit down to
dinner without them; but this want of consideration
soon becomes known in their different sets, and is always
taken into account when "their company is requested at
dinner."</p>

<p>In France, it is not the rule, or the custom, to wait
dinner for late arrivals, and the dinner is served punctually
to the hour named in the invitation.</p>

<p>The dinner-hour varies from eight to nine, although
perhaps 8.30 is the most usual hour. In the country it
ranges from 7.30 to 8.30.</p>

<p>Punctuality on the part of the guests enables the hostess
to make any introductions she may consider advisable
before dinner is served.</p>

<p>The host and hostess should be in readiness to receive
their guests in the drawing-room at the hour specified on
the card.</p>

<p>On arrival, a lady should take off her cloak in the
cloak-room, or should leave it in the hall with the servant
in attendance, before entering the drawing-room.</p>

<p>A gentleman should leave his overcoat and hat in the
gentlemen's cloak-room, or in the hall.</p>

<p>At large dinner-parties, the butler is stationed on the
staircase, and announces the guests as they arrive. At
small dinner-parties, or where only one man-servant is kept,
the servant precedes the guest or guests on their arrival, to
the drawing-room. The guests should then give their
names to the servant, that he may announce them.</p>

<p>A lady and gentleman, on being announced, should not
enter the drawing-room arm-in-arm or side by side. The
lady or ladies, if more than one, should enter the room in
advance of the gentleman, although the servant announces
"Mr., Mrs., and Miss A."</p>

<p>The host and hostess should come forward and shake
hands with each guest on arrival. The ladies should at
once seat themselves, but gentlemen either stand about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
room and talk to each other, or sit down after a wait of
some minutes.</p>

<p>When a lady is acquainted with many of the guests
present, she should not make her way at once to shake
hands with all, but should make an opportunity to do so in
an unobtrusive manner; it would be sufficient to recognise
them by a nod or a smile in the mean time. A lady should
bow to any gentleman she knows, and he should cross the
room to shake hands with her at once if disengaged.</p>

<p>At a small dinner-party, where the guests are unacquainted,
the hostess should introduce the persons of
highest rank to each other; but at a large dinner-party,
she would not do so, unless she had some especial reason
for making the introduction.</p>

<p>In the country, introductions at dinner-parties are far
oftener made than in town.</p>

<p>Precedency is strictly observed at all dinner-parties.
(See <a href="#Page_44">Chapter V</a>.)</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Sending Guests in to Dinner.</big></b>&mdash;The host should
take the lady of highest rank present in to dinner, and the
gentleman of highest rank should take the hostess. This
rule is absolute, unless the lady or gentleman of highest rank
is related to the host or hostess, in which case his or her rank
would be in abeyance, out of courtesy to the other guests.</p>

<p>A husband and wife, or a father and daughter, or a
mother and son, should not be sent in to dinner together.</p>

<p>A host and hostess should, if possible, invite an equal
number of ladies and gentlemen. It is usual to invite two
or more gentlemen than there are ladies, in order that the
married ladies should not be obliged to go in to dinner with
each other's husbands only. Thus, Mrs. A. and Mr. B.,
Mr. B. and Mrs. A., Mrs. B. should be taken in to dinner
by Mr. C., and Mr. A. should take Mrs. G., and so on.</p>

<p>When ladies are in a majority at a dinner-party to the
extent of two or three, the ladies of highest rank should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
be taken in to dinner by the gentlemen present, and the
remaining ladies should follow by themselves; but such an
arrangement is unusual and undesirable, though sometimes
unavoidable when the dinner-party is an impromptu one,
for instance, and the notice given has been but a short one.</p>

<p>If there should be one gentleman short of the number
required, the hostess frequently goes in to dinner by herself,
following in the wake of the last couple.</p>

<p>The usual mode of sending guests in to dinner is for
the host or hostess to inform each gentleman, shortly after
his arrival, which of the ladies he is to take in to dinner.</p>

<p>No "choice" is given to any gentleman as to which of
the ladies he would prefer taking in to dinner, it being
simply a question of precedency.</p>

<p>Should any difficulty arise as to the order in which the
guests should follow the host to the dining-room, the hostess,
knowing the precedency due to each of her guests, should
indicate to each gentleman when it is his turn to descend
to the dining-room. He should then offer his arm to the
lady whom the host had previously desired him to take in
to dinner.</p>

<p>Dinner is announced by the butler or man-servant.</p>

<p>When the guests have arrived, or when the host desires
dinner to be served, he should ring or inform the servant
accordingly.</p>

<p>On dinner being announced, the host should give his
right arm to the lady of highest rank present, and, with
her, lead the way to the dining-room, followed by the lady
second in rank, with a gentleman second in rank and so on.
The gentleman of highest rank present should follow last
with the hostess.</p>

<p>When the second couple are about to leave the drawing-room,
the hostess frequently requests each gentleman in
turn to follow with a lady according to the precedency due
to each. Thus, "Mr. A., will you take Mrs. B.?" This
also answers the purpose of an introduction, should the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
couple be unacquainted with each other, and the hostess
has not found an opportunity of introducing them to each
other on their arrival.</p>

<p>When a case of precedency occurs, in which either the
lady or gentleman must waive their right of precedence,
that of the gentleman gives way to that of the lady. (See
<a href="#Page_44">Chapter V</a>.)</p>

<p>A gentleman should offer his right arm to a lady on
leaving the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen should not proceed to the dining-room
in silence, but should at once enter into conversation
with each other. (See the work entitled "The Art of
Conversing.")</p>

<p>On entering the dining-room the lady whom the host
has taken in to dinner should seat herself at his right hand.
On the Continent this custom is reversed, and it is etiquette
for the lady to sit at the left hand of the gentleman by
whom she is taken in to dinner.</p>

<p>The host should remain standing in his place, at the
bottom of the table, until the guests have taken their seats,
and should motion the various couples as they enter the
dining-room to the places he wishes them to occupy at the
table. This is the most usual method of placing the guests
at the dinner-table. When the host does not indicate where
they are to sit, they sit near to the host or hostess according
to precedency.</p>

<p>The host and hostess should arrange beforehand the
places they wish their guests to occupy at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>If a host did not indicate to the guests the various places
he wished them to occupy, the result would probably be
that husbands and wives would be seated side by side, or
uncongenial people would sit together.</p>

<p>The custom of putting a card with the name of the guest
on the table in the place allotted to each individual guest
is frequently followed at large dinner-parties, and in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
instances the name of each guest is printed on a menu and
placed in front of each cover.</p>

<p>The host and the lady taken in to dinner by him should
sit at the bottom of the table. He should sit in the centre
at the bottom of the table and place the lady whom he has
taken down at his right hand. The same rule applies to
the hostess. She should sit in the centre at the top of the
table, the gentleman by whom she has been taken in to
dinner being placed at her left hand.</p>

<p>The lady second in rank should sit at the host's left
hand.</p>

<p>Each lady should sit at the right hand of the gentleman
by whom she is taken in to dinner.</p>

<p>It is solely a matter of inclination whether a lady and
gentleman, who have gone in to dinner together, converse
with each other only, or with their right-and left-hand
neighbours also, but they usually find some topic of conversation
in common, otherwise a dinner-party would prove
but a succession of <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Menus</big></b> are placed the length of the table, on
an average one to two persons or occasionally one to each
person, and the menu cards are elaborate or simple, according
to individual taste, and are purchased printed for the
purpose, having a space for the names of the dishes to be
filled in, which is usually done by the mistress of the house,
unless the establishment is on a large scale, it being usual
to write them out in French.</p>

<p>Fanciful menu holders are much in use.</p>

<p>The use of menus would be pretentious at a small
dinner-party when there is but little choice of dishes; but
when there is a choice of dishes a menu is indispensable.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Usual and Fashionable Mode of serving
Dinner</big></b> is called <i>D&icirc;ner &agrave; la Russe</i>, although at small or
friendly dinners the host sometimes prefers to carve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
joint himself in the first course, and the birds in the second
course. But dinner-tables, whether for dining <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>,
or for dining <i>en famille</i>, are invariably arranged in the same
style, the difference being merely the extent of the display
made as regards flowers, plate and glass, which are the
accessories of the dining-table.</p>

<p>When the host helps the soup, a small ladleful for each
person is the proper quantity; a soup-plate should not be
filled with soup.</p>

<p>When the party is a small one, and the joints or birds
are carved by the host, the portions should be handed to
the guests in the order in which they are seated, although
occasionally the ladies are helped before the gentlemen.</p>

<p>The rule at all dinner-parties is for the servant to commence
serving by handing the dishes to the lady seated
at the host's right hand, then to the lady seated at the
host's left hand, and from thence the length of the table
to each guest in the order seated, irrespective of sex.</p>

<p>Double <i>entr&eacute;es</i> should be provided at large dinner-parties,
and the servants should commence handing the
dishes at both sides of the table simultaneously.</p>

<p><i>D&icirc;ner &agrave; la Russe</i> is the Russian fashion introduced into
society many years ago. The whole of the dinner is served
from a side-table, no dishes whatever being placed on the
table save dishes of fruit.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Dinner-table Decorations.</big></b>&mdash;As regards the most
correct style of dinner-table decorations, they offer great
diversity of arrangement.</p>

<p>High centre pieces and low centre pieces. Low specimen
glasses placed the length of the table and trails of creepers
and flowers laid on the table-cloth itself are some of the prevailing
features of the day, but table decorations are essentially
a matter of taste rather than of etiquette, and the extent
of these decorations depends very much upon the size of the
plate chest and the length of the purse of the dinner giver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The fruit for dessert is usually arranged down the centre
of the table, amidst the flowers and plate. Some dinner-tables
are also adorned with a variety of French conceits
besides fruit and flowers; other dinner-tables are decorated
with flowers and plate only, the dessert not being placed on
the table at all; but this latter mode can only be adopted
by those who can make a lavish display of flowers and plate
in the place of fruit.</p>

<p>As regards lighting the dinner table. Electric light is
now in general use in town, and more or less in the country
when possible. When not available, lamps and wax
candles are used as heretofore. The shades in use should
be carefully chosen as they add greatly to the comfort of
the guests and to the success of the lighting. Silver
candlesticks are often fitted with small electric lamps, and
handsome silver lamps are brought into use in a similar
manner for the dinner table.</p>

<p>The term "cover" signifies the place laid at table for
each person. It consists of a table-spoon for soup, fish
knife and fork, two knives, two large forks, and glasses
for wines given. For such arrangements see chapter
"Waiting at dinner" in the work entitled "Waiting at
Table."</p>

<p>Sherry is always drunk after soup, hock with the fish
after the soup. Champagne is drunk immediately after the
first <i>entr&eacute;e</i> has been served, and during the remainder of
dinner until dessert. Claret, sherry, port, and Madeira are
the wines drunk at dessert, and not champagne, as it is
essentially a dinner wine. When liqueurs are given they
are handed after the ices.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Dinner-table Etiquette.</big></b>&mdash;Soup should be eaten with
a table-spoon and not with a dessert-spoon, it would be out
of place to use a dessert-spoon for that purpose. Dessert-spoons,
as their name implies, are intended for other purposes,
such as for eating fruit-tarts, custard-puddings, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
or any sweet that is not sufficiently substantial to be eaten
with a fork.</p>

<p>Fish should be eaten with a silver fork when possible,
otherwise with a silver fish knife and fork.</p>

<p>All made dishes, such as <i>quenelles</i>, <i>rissoles</i>, patties, etc.,
should be eaten with a fork only, and not with a knife and
fork.</p>

<p>For sweetbreads and cutlets, etc., a knife and fork are
requisite; and, as a matter of course, for poultry, game, etc.</p>

<p>In eating asparagus, a knife and fork should be used, and
the points should be cut off and eaten with a fork as is sea-kale,
etc.</p>

<p>Salad should be eaten with a knife and fork; it is served
on salad plates, which are placed beside the dinner-plates.</p>

<p>Cucumber is eaten off the dinner-plate, and not off a
separate plate.</p>

<p>Peas should be eaten with a fork.</p>

<p>In eating game or poultry, the bone of either wing or
leg should not be touched with the fingers, but the meat
cut close off the bone; and if a wing it is best to sever it
at the joint, by which means the meat is cut off far more
easily.</p>

<p>Pastry should be eaten with a fork, but in the case of a
fruit tart, a dessert-spoon should be used as well as a fork,
but only for the purpose of conveying the fruit and juice to
the mouth; and in the case of stone fruit&mdash;cherries, damsons,
plums, etc.&mdash;either the dessert-spoon or fork should be
raised to the lips to receive the stones, which should be
placed at the side of the plate; but when the fruit stones
are of larger size, they should be separated from the fruit
with the fork and spoon, and left on the plate, and not put
into the mouth; and whenever it is possible to separate the
stones from the fruit it is best to do so.</p>

<p>Jellies, blancmanges, ice puddings, etc., should be eaten
with a fork, as should be all sweets sufficiently substantial
to admit of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>When eating cheese, small morsels of the cheese should
be placed with the knife on small morsels of bread, and the
two conveyed to the mouth with the thumb and finger, the
piece of bread being the morsel to hold, as cheese should
not be taken up in the fingers, and should not be eaten off
the point of the knife.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The finger-glass should be removed from the ice-plate
and placed on the left-hand side of the dessert-plate. When
ices are not given, the d'oyley should be removed with the
finger-glass and placed beneath it.</p>

<p>When eating grapes, the half-closed hand should be
placed to the mouth, and the stones and skins allowed to
fall into the fingers, and placed on the side of the plate.
Some persons bend the head so as to allow of the stones
and skins of the grapes falling on the side of the plate; but
this latter way is old-fashioned, and seldom followed.
Cherries and other small stone-fruit should be eaten in the
way grapes are eaten, also gooseberries.</p>

<p>When strawberries and raspberries, etc., are not eaten
with cream, they should be eaten from the stalks; when
eaten with cream, a dessert-spoon should be used to remove
them from the stalks. When served in the American
fashion without stalks, both fork and spoon should be
used.</p>

<p>Pears and apples should be peeled and cut into halves
and quarters with a fruit-knife and fork, as should peaches,
nectarines, and apricots.</p>

<p>Melons should be eaten with a spoon and fork.</p>

<p>Pines with knife and fork.</p>

<p>The dessert is handed to the guests in the order in which
the dinner has been served.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>When the guests have been helped to wine, and the
servants have left the dining-room, the host should pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the decanters to his guests, commencing with the gentleman
nearest to him.</p>

<p>It is not the fashion for gentlemen to drink wine with
each other either at dinner or dessert, and the guest fills his
glass or not, according to inclination.</p>

<p>Ladies are not supposed to require a second glass of
wine at dessert, and passing the decanters is principally for
the gentlemen. If a lady should require a second glass of
wine at dessert, the gentleman seated next to her would fill
her glass; she should not help herself to wine. After the
wine has been passed once around the table, or about ten
minutes after the servants have left the dining-room, the
hostess should give the signal for the ladies to leave the
dining-room, by bowing to the lady of highest rank present,
seated at the host's right hand. She should then rise from
her seat, as should all the ladies on seeing her do so.</p>

<p>The gentlemen should rise also, and remain standing by
their chairs until the ladies have quitted the room, which
they should do in the order in which they have entered
it, the lady of highest rank leading the way, the hostess
following last.</p>

<p>The host, or the gentleman nearest the door, should
open it for the ladies to pass out, and close it after them.</p>

<p>When the ladies have left the dining-room, the gentlemen
should close up as near to the host as possible, so as
to render conversation general.</p>

<p>The wines usually drunk by gentlemen after dinner are
claret of a fine quality, and port.</p>

<p>The ladies on leaving the dining-room return to the
drawing-room. Coffee should be almost immediately
brought to the drawing-room. The coffee-cups containing
coffee should be brought on a silver salver, with a cream-jug
and a basin of crystallised sugar.</p>

<p>In large country houses coffee is sometimes brought in
a silver coffee-pot, and the lady would then pour out her
own coffee, the servant holding the salver the meanwhile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Coffee should be taken a few minutes later to the
dining-room, and either handed to the gentlemen, or placed
on the table, that they may help themselves (see the work
previously referred to).</p>

<p>A very general plan is, after the wine has gone round
once or twice, for the host to offer cigarettes, which are
smoked before the gentlemen join the ladies in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>After coffee, the gentleman of highest rank should leave
the dining-room first. The host would not propose an
adjournment to the drawing-room, until he observed a wish
to do so on the part of his guests, but there is no hard and
fast rule on this head.</p>

<p>It is not now the fashion for gentlemen to sit over their
wine beyond fifteen or twenty minutes at the utmost, instead
of as formerly, from three-quarters of an hour to an hour, a
change much appreciated by hostesses.</p>

<p>On the Continent the gentlemen accompany the ladies
to the drawing-room, and do not remain in the dining-room
as in England.</p>

<p>The gentleman of highest rank present could suggest an
adjournment to the drawing-room within a quarter of an
hour if he thought proper to do so. If the other guests
were engaged in a discussion in which he did not wish to
take part, having suggested the adjournment, he could leave
the dining-room to join the ladies in the drawing-room;
but as a rule, the gentlemen leave the dining-room together,
the host following last.</p>

<p>The host should ring the dining-room bell before leaving
the room, as an intimation to the butler that the gentlemen
have left the room.</p>

<p>At ceremonious dinner-parties in town neither music
nor cards are introduced during the usual half-hour passed
in the drawing-room before the hour for departure.</p>

<p>At country-house dinner-parties music or round games
of cards are in request.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Departure after Dinner.</big></b>&mdash;There is no rule as to the
order in which the guests should take their leave. Half-past
ten is the usual hour for general departure; and the
butler announces the several carriages as they arrive to the
guests in the drawing-room. But if any lady wished to
inquire if her carriage had arrived, she should ask the
hostess's permission to do so; and the bell would be rung
for the purpose of making the enquiry. The same remark
applies to ordering a cab: the lady should ask the hostess
if one might be ordered for her.</p>

<p>The hostess should shake hands with all her guests on
their departure, rising from her seat to do so.</p>

<p>Each guest on departure should shake hands with both
host and hostess.</p>

<p>If, on leaving the room, acquaintances should pass each
other, they should wish each other good-night, but they
should not make the tour of the rooms for the purpose of
so doing.</p>

<p>The host should conduct one or two of the principal of
his lady guests to their carriages.</p>

<p>The ladies should put on their cloaks in the cloak-room,
the host waiting in the hall meanwhile.</p>

<p>A gentleman related to the host or hostess, or a friend
of the family, could offer to conduct a lady to her carriage
if the host were otherwise engaged.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gratuities</big></b> should never be offered by the guests at a
dinner-party to the servants in attendance. Gentlemen
should not offer fees to the men-servants, neither should
ladies to the lady's-maid in attendance.</p>

<p>The guests should call on the hostess within a week or
ten days after a dinner-party. If "not at home," a married
lady should leave one of her own cards and two of her
husband's; a widow should leave one of her own cards; a
bachelor or a widower should leave two cards.</p>

<p>The rule as to calling after dinner-parties is greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
relaxed between intimate friends, and the call often omitted
altogether; and this more particularly as regards gentlemen,
whose occupations during the day are considered good and
sufficient reasons for not calling.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Country Dinner-Parties.</big></b>&mdash;In the country, new
acquaintances, if neighbours, should be asked to dinner
within a month of the first call if possible, and the return
invitation should be given within the following month.</p>

<p>When guests are assembled at a country house, they are
sent in to dinner, on the first evening, according to their
individual precedence; but on subsequent evenings the
gentlemen frequently draw lots to decide which lady they
shall have the pleasure of taking in to dinner, otherwise a
lady and gentleman would go in to dinner together five or
six consecutive times, according to the length of the visit,
but this is more a practice with people who march with the
times, than with what are termed "old-fashioned people."</p>

<p>When a party is varied by additional dinner-guests each
evening, drawing lots gives way to precedency, it being too
familiar a practice to be adopted at a large dinner-party.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Saying Grace</big></b>, both before and after dinner, is a
matter of feeling rather than of etiquette. It used to be
very much the custom to say "grace," but of late years
it is oftener omitted than not, especially at large dinner-parties
in town.</p>

<p>In the country, when a clergyman is present, he should
be asked to say grace. When grace is said by the host, it
is said in a low voice, and in a very few words; the guests
inclining their heads the while.</p>

<p>It was no rapid revolutionary change in manners that
brought about the difference that now exists between the
Elizabethan and present eras; no polished mentor came
forward to teach that it was not the nicest and cleanest
thing to do, to put knives into the salt, to dip fingers into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
plates, or to spread butter with the thumb; on the contrary,
these things righted themselves little by little, step by step,
until the present code of manners was arrived at. But it
is quite possible that a hundred years hence it will be discovered
that the manners of the present century offered
wide scope for improvement.</p>

<p>In the meantime these rules of etiquette observed in
society are adhered to and followed by those who do not
wish to appear singular, eccentric, old-fashioned, unconventional,
or any other adjective that the temper of their
judges may induce them to apply to them for committing
solecisms, either small or great.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Married Ladies, as a rule, dine out with their
Husbands</big></b>, and do not accept invitations to large dinners
when their husbands are unable to accompany them. There
are, of course, exceptions to this rule, and circumstances
sometimes arise when it is greatly relaxed; but even in this
case it would be in favour of small and friendly dinners
rather than large ones.</p>

<p>During any temporary absence of her husband, a lady
would accept invitations to dine with her relatives and
intimate friends, though she might refuse invitations to
large dinners given by acquaintances; but, as a rule, when
it is well known that the head of a house is away for any
length of time, invitations are seldom sent to the wife by
givers of large dinners.</p>

<p>When young ladies are invited to dinner they accompany
their father, mother or brother; but occasionally, when a
young ladies' party is given by a friend of their parents',
the young ladies are invited alone, and they should either
go with their maid in a cab or by themselves in their father's
carriage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>DINNER-TABLE ETIQUETTE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Fashion</span> has its freaks and its vagaries, and in relation to
inanimate objects these freaks and vagaries are but transitory
and evanescent, but when they touch upon manners
and modes they become a conventionality and a custom
perhaps for many a year. Changes and innovations, slight
as they are, are more subtle than sudden, and, paradoxical
as it may seem, they are as important as they are insignificant;
still it is difficult to believe that fingers once did
duty for forks, and that it was not customary for a host to
supply his guests with forks, who, if fastidious enough to
require them, were expected to bring them in their pockets.</p>

<p>There are here and there people in society who affect a
few eccentricities of manner, but these whims at all times
take the form of originalities and not of vulgarities; and
even then are only indulged in by those whose position
in society is secure.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards Dinner-table Etiquette.</big></b>&mdash;When a lady
has taken her seat at the dinner-table, she should at once
remove her gloves; although occasionally long elbow gloves
are not removed during dinner, but this is conspicuous and
inconvenient. She should unfold her serviette and place it
on her lap. It is immaterial whether she places the bread
on the right or left-hand side of the cover when taking it
from the serviette.</p>

<p>A gentleman should do the same with his serviette and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bread, placing the one across his knees, and the other at
his right or left hand.</p>

<p>When a lady is some little time taking off her gloves,
she should remove her serviette before doing so: otherwise
a servant would offer her soup before she had made room
for the soup-plate by removing the serviette, and she should
decide quickly as to which of the two soups handed to her
she will take, so as not to keep the servant waiting; and so
on through every course throughout the dinner as regards
fish, meat, etc.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The guests should consult the menu</big></b> on first
sitting down to dinner. Eating soup comes first under notice.
In olden days it was customary to drink it out of a basin.
In these days no one "drinks" soup, it is "eaten"; whether
it be mock turtle or the clearest julienne, it is eaten out of a
soup-plate at dinner, and with a table-spoon.</p>

<p>There is a reason for this choice of spoons; soup is
nothing if it is not hot, and as it is the custom to give only
about half a ladleful to each person, it is eaten quicker, and
therefore hotter, with a large spoon than with a small one.</p>

<p>There is also a good and sufficient reason for small
quantities of soup being given in lieu of large ones, viz. the
extent of the menu; and when a plateful of soup is handed
to a guest accustomed to the regulation supply, he fears
that he is expected to dine off it, and that there is nothing
much to follow.</p>

<p>Again, small helpings require a smaller quantity of
soup to be provided, and a servant is less likely to spill
plates containing a little soup than plates that are half
full.</p>

<p>At ball suppers, when soup is served in soup-plates, it
is also eaten with a table-spoon, but not when served in
small cups.</p>

<p>Many years ago it was fashionable to eat fish with a fork
and a crust of bread; previous to this a table-knife and fork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
were considered the proper things to use for this purpose.
It was then discovered that a steel knife gave an unpalatable
flavour to the fish, and a crust of bread was substituted for
the knife. This fashion lasted a considerable time, in spite
of the fingers being thus brought unpleasantly near to the
plate, and to this day old-fashioned people have a predilection
for that crust of bread. One evening a well-known
diner-out discarded his crust of bread, and ate his fish with
two silver forks; this notion found such general favour that
society dropped the humble crust and took up a second
fork. This fashion had its little day, but at length the two
forks were found heavy for the purpose and not altogether
satisfactory, and were superseded by the dainty and convenient
little silver fish-knife and fork which are now in
general use.</p>

<p>Small pieces of fish should always be given, and two
different sorts of fish should not be placed on the same plate.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When oysters are given</big></b> they precede the soup, and
should be eaten with a dinner-fork, not with a fish-fork. In
eating oysters the shell should be steadied on the plate with
the fingers of the left hand, the oysters should not be cut,
but should be eaten whole. Very many ladies do not eat
oysters at dinner simply because they do not like them,
while others refuse them under the impression that it is
more ladylike not to eat them. Perhaps with regard to
young ladies it is a taste to be acquired. Some men are
very, if not over, fastidious, about the appetites displayed
by ladies, and would have them reject the <i>entr&eacute;es</i> and dine
upon a slice of chicken and a spoonful of jelly. Others, on
the contrary, respect a good appetite as giving proof of
good health and good digestion. There is of course a
medium in all things, and as large dinners are ordered
mainly with a view to please the palates of men with
epicurean tastes, it is not expected that ladies should eat of
the most highly seasoned and richest of the dishes given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
but should rather select the plainest on the menu. This
remark more particularly applies to young ladies and young
married ladies, whilst middle-aged and elderly ladies are at
liberty to do pretty much as they please, without provoking
comment or even observation.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>With reference to entr&eacute;es</big></b>, some are eaten with a
knife and fork, others with a fork only. All <i>entr&eacute;es</i> that offer
any resistance to a fork require the aid of both knife and
fork, such as cutlets, <i>filet de b&#339;uf</i>, sweetbreads, etc., but
when <i>rissoles</i>, patties, <i>quenelles</i>, boneless curry, <i>vol-au-vents</i>,
<i>timbales</i>, etc., are eaten, the fork only should be used.</p>

<p>In the case of the lighter <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, the contact of the
knife is supposed to militate against their delicate flavour;
thus, for these <i>bonnes bouches</i> the fork is all-sufficient wherewith
to divide and eat them.</p>

<p>The leg of a chicken, pheasant, duck, or wild duck should
never be given to a guest save on those occasions when there
are more guests present than there is meat from breasts and
wings to offer them. Under these circumstances the carver
is reduced to the necessity of falling back upon the legs of the
birds, but in this case only the upper part of the thigh should
be given, thus a guest has little difficulty in cutting the meat
from the bone. A wing of a bird is usually given to a lady.
Formerly it was thought a correct thing to sever the wing
at the joint and then to cut the meat from the bone; but
this requires a certain amount of strength in the wrist, and
dexterity, should the bird not be in its <i>premi&egrave;re jeunesse</i>.</p>

<p>As regards small pigeons, golden plovers, snipe, quails,
larks, etc., a whole bird is given to each guest, and the
proper way to eat these birds is to cut the meat from the
breast and wings and to eat each morsel at the moment of
cutting it; the bird should not be turned over and over on
the plate, or cut in half or otherwise dissected. The legs
of Bordeaux pigeons are not, as a rule, eaten, and half a
bird only is given, as there is sufficient on the wing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
breast to satisfy an ordinary second-course appetite. When
the legs of smaller birds are eaten, such as snipe or golden
plover, the meat should be cut off as from the breast or wing.</p>

<p>Young girls, as a rule, seldom eat a second course
delicacy of this description; a little chicken or pheasant
on the contrary is usually accepted by them.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When large potatoes are served</big></b> in their skins a
salad-plate should be handed at the same time whereon to
place them.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When asparagus first comes into season</big></b> it is often
given in the second course instead of in the first, in which case
it is eaten as a separate dish. When handed with meat or
poultry it should be eaten on the same plate containing either.</p>

<p>In eating asparagus, some elderly gentlemen still adhere
to the fashion of their youth and hold the stalks in their
fingers, but the younger generation cut off the points with
a knife and fork.</p>

<p>Sea-kale also is given in the second course when first in
season, and should be eaten with a knife and fork.</p>

<p>Mushrooms are also eaten with a knife and fork.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that it would be a vulgarity to
eat peas with a knife, although those who reside abroad, or
who are in the habit of travelling on the continent, are not
unaccustomed to seeing this done by foreigners who are
well-bred men.</p>

<p>Artichokes are, it may be said, an awkward and untidy
vegetable to eat; they are only given in the second course
as a separate vegetable; the outside leaves should be
removed with the knife and fork, and the inner leaves
which surround the heart, or head of the artichoke should
be conveyed to the mouth with the fingers and sucked dry;
epicures consider this vegetable a dainty morsel, but at
dinner-parties young ladies should not attempt to eat these
artichokes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Savouries, when possible, should be eaten with a fork,
but occasionally a knife also is of imperative use.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards sweets</big></b>, <i>comp&ocirc;tes</i> of fruit and fruit tarts
should be eaten with a dessert-spoon and fork, as should
those dishes where juice or syrup prevails to the extent of
rendering a dessert-spoon necessary. But whenever it is
possible to use a fork in preference to a spoon it is always
better to do so.</p>

<p>Jellies, creams, blancmanges, ice puddings, etc., should
be eaten with a fork.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, young ladies do not eat cheese at
dinner-parties.</p>

<h3>EVENING PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Evening Parties</big></b> are styled receptions or "at homes"
according to the number of guests invited. In official and
political circles they are invariably styled "Receptions,"
but when given on a smaller scale in general society they
are styled "At Homes."</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations</big></b> to evening parties should be issued on
"at home" cards.</p>

<p>The name of the person invited should be written at the
top of the card at the right-hand corner, the words "at
home" being printed beneath the name of the lady issuing
the invitation, the day and date beneath the words "at
home," the hour beneath the date. The address should
be printed at the bottom of the card.</p>

<p>When music is to be given it should be mentioned on
the "at home" card, thus, "Music."</p>

<p>The hour varies from 10 to 11 o'clock; in private
circles 10 or 10.30 is the usual hour; in official circles
10.30 or 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>When a foreign royal personage is expected, or a
foreigner of distinction, or a personage possessing public
interest, the words "To meet Her Serene Highness
Princess D.," or "To meet Count C." should be written at
the top of the invitation cards.</p>

<p>When a reception or "at home" follows a dinner-party
given by the hostess, it is not usual to provide any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
special amusement for the guests. But when an "at
home" does not follow a dinner-party, it is usual to
provide some sort of amusement for the guests, such as
professional vocal or instrumental music.</p>

<p>The guests are expected to arrive from half an hour to
an hour of the time mentioned on the invitation card,
although it is optional when they do so.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Receiving the Guests.</big></b>&mdash;The hostess should receive
her guests at the head of the staircase, where she usually
remains until the principal of her guests have arrived;
while the host welcomes the guests in the drawing-room
itself.</p>

<p>Receptions or "at homes" usually terminate shortly
before one o'clock, save on Saturdays, when the hour of
departure is 12 o'clock precisely.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Making Introductions.</big></b>&mdash;A hostess should use her
own discretion as regards making introductions.</p>

<p>When a royal personage is present the most distinguished
of the guests should be presented by the host or
hostess. When a celebrity is present introductions should
also be made; and as regards general introductions they
should be made whenever the hostess judges it expedient
to do so, and the principal guests when unacquainted
should be introduced to each other when the opportunity
occurs.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Going in to Supper.</big></b>&mdash;The host should take the lady
of highest rank in to supper.</p>

<p>When a royal princess is present the host should take
her in to supper.</p>

<p>When a royal prince is present he should take the
hostess in to supper. (See <a href="#Page_44">Chapter V</a>.)</p>

<p>It is optional whether the hostess follows with the
gentleman of highest rank present, unless a foreign prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
is present, when she should follow the host, and in the
case of a royal prince being present she should precede
the host.</p>

<p>When a royal prince or princess or a serene highness
is present a table should be set apart for the host and
hostess and royal party, and any among the guests
whom the royal visitors may desire should join them at
supper.</p>

<p>When the supper-room is not sufficiently large to accommodate
the whole of the guests at the same time, the
most distinguished guests should go in first.</p>

<p>When the host is informed that supper is served he
should tell the principal gentlemen present which of the
ladies he wishes them to take into supper, and should
himself lead the way with the lady of highest rank
present.</p>

<p>The hostess should also assist in sending the principal
guests in to supper, and when the general company observe
the move towards the supper-room, they should follow in
the same direction.</p>

<p>When the general company are apparently not
aware that the supper-room is open, the hostess should
ask the various gentlemen to take the ladies in to
supper, and should herself lead the way with one of
the gentlemen.</p>

<p>When the general company find the supper-room
crowded they should return to the drawing-room for a
quarter of an hour or so; but the hostess should arrange
for some instrumental or vocal performance to commence
when supper is first served, so as to occupy the attention of
the guests who remain in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The guests frequently do not return to the drawing-room
after supper, but go to the cloak-room for their cloaks and
wraps, and thence to their carriages.</p>

<p>It is not usual to take leave of the host and hostess at
receptions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Royal Guests present.</big></b>&mdash;When a royal personage is
present the host should conduct her to her carriage.</p>

<p>When a foreign prince is present the host should
accompany him to the hall door.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Tea and Light Refreshments</big></b> should be served
during the evening in the library, or in an adjacent
apartment.</p>

<p>Supper should be served at twelve o'clock, in the dining-room,
and should be similar in character to a ball supper.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations to Bridge Parties</big></b> are issued on "at
home" cards when the guests number upwards of forty, and
on visiting cards when a lesser number is invited.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Invitation Form</big></b> is, "Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash; At Home"
in both instances. The day, date, and hour are put
beneath the words "at home," and "Bridge" in the corner
of the cards opposite the address. The usual hour for holding
these evening receptions is 9 o'clock p.m., which allows
of three hours' play before midnight. The guests arrive very
punctually, rather before than after the hour named on the
invitation cards. The guests comprise an equal number of
both sexes, as husbands and wives are invited together when
both are known to be bridge players, and bachelors who do
not disdain playing for small stakes are in great request.
Also unmarried ladies of a certain age; not girls in their
teens.</p>

<p>Prizes are given in some houses to the conquering
players. One for the ladies and one for the gentlemen, and
occasionally a second prize for the second best player of
either sex. This is done when playing for money does not
commend itself to a host and hostess. The prizes consist
for the most part of useful articles. For instance, a box of
gloves, a box of bon-bons, a case of eau d'Cologne, a card-case,
a bag purse, and so on, all of which are acceptable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
ladies; and a box of cigars or cigarettes, a silver pocket-flask,
a silver-mounted stick or umbrella, are prizes the men
winners are pleased to accept.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridge Tables</big></b> at which the guests are to sit are
numbered, and the hostess arranges by whom they are to
be occupied. The names&mdash;four in number for each table&mdash;are
written or printed with the number of the table upon
small cards and given to the guests by the hostess on
arrival. This is done that good players may be placed
together, and to save confusion and loss of time in seating
them at the various tables.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Refreshments</big></b> provided consist in the first instance
of "coffee," which is brought into the card-room or drawing-room
and handed to the guests. No eatables are given
with this after-dinner coffee. A supper is given either at
the conclusion of the play at 12 o'clock&mdash;this being the
more usual plan&mdash;or at 10.30, after which play is resumed
for another hour or so; but the latter is more of a provincial
custom than a town one, and is intended for those
whose dinner hour is an early one&mdash;6.30, perhaps.</p>

<p>When a supper is not given, very good light refreshments
are substituted for it, including cups of hot soup in
the winter months.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Going in to Supper</big></b> is arranged as far as possible on
the following lines, if precedence does not prevent its being
carried out. The players at each table who are partners
when supper is served go in together. The host leads the
way with his partner, and all follow, the hostess and her
partner going last.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Cards should be left</big></b> within a week or ten days after
a reception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>A married lady should leave one of her own and two of
her husband's cards.</p>

<p>A widow should leave one of her own cards.</p>

<p>A bachelor or widower should leave two of his cards.
(See <a href="#Page_19">Chapter III</a>.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>WEDDINGS AND WEDDING LUNCHEONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Afternoon Weddings</big></b> are invariably solemnised at 2.30
o'clock. Only very quiet weddings take place in the
morning hours. Formerly, it was only the few who were
in a position to obtain special licences who could have
afternoon weddings.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Marriage by "Banns"</big></b> is greatly in favour in general
society. The banns must be published three consecutive
weeks previous to the marriage in the parish in which
the bridegroom resides, and also in that in which the bride
resides, and both should reside fifteen days in their respective
parishes previous to the banns being published.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Marriages by Licence.</big></b>&mdash;When a marriage is solemnised
by licence the cost, with fees and stamps, amounts
to &pound;2. This should be obtained at the Faculty Office, or
at the Vicar-General's Office, Doctors' Commons, and is
available at any church in the parish where one of the
parties has resided for fifteen days previous to the application
being made for the licence, either in town or country.</p>

<p>When the licence is obtained in the country through a
clerical surrogate the cost varies, according to the diocese,
from &pound;1 15<i>s.</i> to &pound;2 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Special Licences</big></b> can only be obtained from the Archbishop
of Canterbury, after application at the Faculty Office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and an especial reason must be given for the application,
and one that will meet with the Archbishop's approval.</p>

<p>The fees for a special marriage licence average &pound;29
5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Fees</big></b> to the officiating clergymen vary considerably,
according to the position and means of the bridegroom,
from &pound;1 1<i>s.</i> to &pound;5 5<i>s.</i>, as the inclination of the
bridegroom may dictate.</p>

<p>The fee to the verger is subject to a like variation, commencing
at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>All fees relating to a marriage should be defrayed by
the bridegroom, and paid by him, or by the best man on his
behalf, in the vestry of the church, previous to the ceremony;
immediately after it, or some days earlier.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Etiquette observed at Weddings</big></b> is invariably
the same whether the wedding takes place in the
morning or in the afternoon, or whether it is a grand
wedding or a comparatively small one, whether the guests
number two hundred or whether they number twenty.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Invitations</big></b> should be issued from three weeks to
a fortnight before the wedding-day.</p>

<p>The wedding luncheon or wedding reception should be
given by the parents of the bride or by her nearest relative, and
the invitations should be issued in the names of both parents.</p>

<p>The invitations should be issued in notes printed in ink;
they are now seldom printed in silver. The form should
be as follows: "Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; request the pleasure of
Mr. and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s company at the marriage of their
daughter Helen with Mr. John S&mdash;&mdash;, at St. Peter's Church,
Hanover Square, on Tuesday, May 8th, at 2.30 o'clock, and
afterwards at &mdash;&mdash; Square. R.S.V.P."</p>

<p>If a stepdaughter, it should be "at the marriage of Mrs.
A&mdash;&mdash;'s daughter Helen B&mdash;&mdash;."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Wedding Presents.</big></b>&mdash;Every one who is invited to a
wedding invariably makes the bride or bridegroom a present;
it is the received rule to do so. Many send presents before
the invitations are sent out&mdash;as soon as the engagement is
made known, if it is not to be a long one.</p>

<p>There is no rule as to the time before the wedding-day
when the present should be sent; but invitations are usually
sent to those who have given presents, even though they
live at a considerable distance, and may not be able to
attend the wedding.</p>

<p>Wedding presents are displayed on tables of various
sizes, according to their number, and if very numerous
and valuable, it is not unusual to exhibit them at an afternoon
tea, given for the purpose on the day previous to the
wedding. Each present should bear the card of the giver
attached to it. Presents of silver plate should be placed
on a table covered with dark cloth or velvet. It is not
unusual to surround the presents with flowers, notably roses,
and this is often done by persons of artistic tastes.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridegroom should provide</big></b> the wedding-ring
and the bridal bouquet.</p>

<p>The bouquets for the bridesmaids are also the gift of
the bridegroom, and should be sent to them on the morning
of the wedding. He is also expected to make a present
to each bridesmaid&mdash;either a brooch, a locket, a bracelet,
or a fan, which should either be sent the day before the
wedding or on the morning of the wedding-day.</p>

<p>The bridegroom should provide the motor-car to
convey himself and his bride from the church to the
house where the wedding luncheon and reception are to
take place, and again from the house to the railway-station,
or, if the journey is made by road, to the place of honeymoon;
but frequently the bride's father places his own
motor-car at the disposal of the bride and bridegroom for
this purpose, especially in the country. The bridal carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
is the only one, according to etiquette, which the bridegroom
is expected to provide.</p>

<p>The invited guests should provide their own conveyances,
and neither the bridegroom nor the bride's father are ever
expected to do so. This should be thoroughly understood
by the guests in every case.</p>

<p>The custom of having groomsmen to support the bridegroom
is now very general, as at royal weddings, a royal
bridegroom being supported by from four to six groomsmen.
Two of the groomsmen usually act as ushers and
assist in seating the guests.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Best Man</big></b> should be a bachelor, although a
married man could act in this capacity. He should either
accompany the bridegroom to the church or meet him there.
He should stand at his right hand during the ceremony&mdash;a
little in the rear&mdash;and should render him the trifling service
of handing him his hat at the close of it.</p>

<p>He should sign the register afterwards in the vestry, and
should pay the fees to the clergyman and to the verger, on
behalf of the bridegroom, either before or after the ceremony,
if the bridegroom does not pay them on arrival.</p>

<p>The bridegroom and best man should arrive at the
church before the bride, and await her coming, standing
at the right-hand side of the chancel gates.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride</big></b> should be driven to the church in her father's
motor-car. If she has a sister or sisters, and they officiate as
bridesmaids, they, with her mother, should precede her to
the church. The motor-car should then return to fetch the
bride and her father; but when she has no sisters, her
father generally precedes her to the church, and receives
her at the church door, her mother accompanying her in
the motor-car.</p>

<p>The bridesmaids should arrive some little time before
the bride, and form a line on either side of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
porch, or within the church doorway. The mother of the
bride usually stands beside them.</p>

<p>When the bride arrives she should take her father's right
arm, or the right arm of her eldest brother or nearest male
relative, who is deputed to give her away; he should meet
her at the church door in the place of her father, and
conduct her to the chancel or altar.</p>

<p>At choral weddings the clergy and choir head the
bridal procession and lead the way to the chancel, singing
a hymn the while.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridesmaids</big></b> should follow the bride and her
father up the nave of the church. When the number of
bridesmaids is even, four, six, eight, or twelve; but when
the number is odd, as five, seven, or nine, and three of
them happen to be children, which is generally the case,
the elder bridesmaids should walk "two and two," following
next after the children.</p>

<p>At fashionable weddings one or two little boys act as
pages, and occasionally bear the bride's train.</p>

<p>The head bridesmaid is generally the bride's eldest
unmarried sister or the bridegroom's sister, and she should
follow next to the bride with her companion bridesmaid,
when children are not included in the group.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride's Mother</big></b> should follow next to the bridesmaids,
and walk by the side of her son, or other male relative,
in following them up the nave of the church. Ladies
and gentlemen do not walk arm-in-arm at a wedding, but
side by side.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride's Immediate Relatives</big></b> and the near
relatives of the bridegroom should seat themselves in pews
or chairs, according to the church in which the service is
celebrated. In some churches the service takes place at
the entrance of the chancel, and the bridal party enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
chancel and stand at the altar to receive the address, and the
concluding portion of the service only is there celebrated.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridegroom's Relatives</big></b> should place themselves
on entering at the right of the nave, thus being on
the bridegroom's right hand, and seat themselves in pews.
The relatives of the bride should place themselves on
entering at the left of the nave, thus being on the bride's
left hand, and seat themselves in pews or chairs. Large
cards with the words "For the Relatives of the Bridegroom,"
"For the Relatives of the Bride," are frequently
placed in the pews to indicate where they are to sit.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride</big></b> should stand at the bridegroom's left hand;
the bride's father, or nearest male relative, should stand at
her left hand, in order to give her away.</p>

<p>The bridesmaids should stand immediately behind the
bride in the order in which they pass up the church.</p>

<p>The bride should take off her gloves at the commencement
of the service and should give them with her bouquet
to the head bridesmaid to hold.</p>

<p>The invited guests should sit in the pews or chairs.</p>

<p>Guests seldom take their prayer-books with them to the
church to follow the service therefrom. The hymns sung
are usually printed on leaflets, and placed in the pews or
on the seats.</p>

<p>The bridegroom generally wears a flower in his button-hole,
as he does not wear a wedding favour.</p>

<p>The other gentlemen may, as a matter of course, wear
button-hole bouquets, if they please.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When the Service is concluded</big></b>, the bride should
take the bridegroom's left arm, and, preceded by the
officiating clergyman, and followed by her head bridesmaids,
father, mother, and the most distinguished of the
guests, should enter the vestry, where the register should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
be signed by the bride and bridegroom, two or three of
the nearest relatives, and by two or three of the most intimate
of the friends, and principal of the guests, including
the best man and the head bridesmaid. The bride's father
should sign it, but it is optional whether the bride's mother
does so or not.</p>

<p>When the register has been signed, and those in the
vestry have shaken hands with the bride and offered their
congratulations, the bride should take the bridegroom's
left arm and pass down the nave of the church followed
by her bridesmaids, in the same order as they have previously
passed up the nave.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom usually leave the church
without pausing to shake hands with many of their friends
present if a reception is to follow.</p>

<p>When the bride and bridegroom have driven off from
the church, the bride's mother should be the next to follow,
that she may be at home to receive the guests as they
arrive. There is no precedence as to the order in which
the remainder of the company leave the church; it entirely
depends on the cleverness of their servants in getting up
their motor-cars.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Button-hole Bouquets</big></b> of natural flowers have entirely
superseded the old-fashioned wedding favours for
both ladies and gentlemen, and are sometimes offered to
the guests before they leave their seats at the conclusion of
the ceremony, but not invariably so. Button-hole bouquets
should be worn on the left side, by both ladies and
gentlemen.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Bride who is a Widow</big></b> should not wear a bridal
veil, nor a wreath of orange-blossoms, nor orange-blossom
on her dress.</p>

<p>She should not be attended by bridesmaids, and wedding
favours should not be worn by the guests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>How the Invitations to the Wedding Reception
of a Widow</big></b> should be issued depends upon individual
circumstances. For instance, if a young widow resides
with her parents, the invitations should be issued in their
names as at her first marriage, and the form of invitation
should be similar, save that the words "Their daughter,
Mrs. A., widow of Mr. A." should be substituted for her
christian name. If, as is very frequently the case, a widow
resides in her own house, or if the marriage is to take
place from an hotel, the invitations should be issued in
her own name, and the form should be "Mrs. Cecil A.
requests the pleasure (or the honour) of Mr. and Mrs.
B.'s company at her marriage with Mr. Henry C., at St.
George's Church on Tuesday, December 30th, at 2.30
o'clock, and afterwards at Eaton Gardens, R.S.V.P." "The
presence of" instead of "the company of" may be put if
preferred.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is understood that a Widow should not have
Bridesmaids</big></b>, but it is open to her to have the attendance
of pages, if a wedding is to be a fashionable and smart one,
although many ladies do not avail themselves of this privilege.
The bridegroom should have a best man, as a matter
of course; he may be the bride's brother if desired (the
idea that this is not permitted is an erroneous one). A
married man might be asked to act in the capacity of best
man, there being no bridesmaids to require his attention,
although this is seldom done, and a bachelor brother or
friend is preferred.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Widow may be given away</big></b> by her father, uncle,
brother, or even by a friend; indeed, it is more usual to
have this support than not. At a first marriage "to be
given away" is imperative, at a second it is optional; and
if a widow at a quiet wedding prefers not to follow this
custom she can do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Much Uncertainty exists as to whether a
Widow should or should not continue to wear
her First Wedding Ring</big></b> when she marries a second
time. In point of fact there is no hard and fast rule with
regard to it, and a widow may continue or not continue to
wear it, as she feels inclined. If she has children, and has
had some years of married life, she usually retains it. If
she is a young widow, she is likely to remove it, and wear
the second ring only; but when this is her intention, she
should not cease to wear it until she has arrived at the
church, and has taken off her gloves previous to the ceremony;
but, take it all in all, it is more usual to wear the
two wedding rings than the second one only.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Formerly, Widows considered it Imperative to
be married in Widow's Colours</big></b>, grey or mauve, and
that white was forbidden wear; but it is no longer so
regarded, and a widow may and does wear white or cream
on her wedding-day&mdash;not exactly a maiden bridal dress, as
a tinge of colour is introduced. The larger number still
regard pale grey or pale heliotrope as more suitable on the
occasion of a second marriage, and doubtless this is so
when a widow is not in her first youth. A widow may not,
of course, wear a bridal veil; she must wear a hat or toque,
white or coloured, as she pleases. She can have a bouquet,
not of white flowers only, but mauve or pink, or violets,
according to choice. It is quite permissible to have a full
choral service, and for the church in which the ceremony
is performed to be decorated with plants and flowers, but
wedding favours should not be given to the guests at its
conclusion.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Widow has a reception the Newly
Married Pair should receive their Guests</big></b> standing
together. The bride's mother, or near relative, could
assist them in receiving. If a luncheon is to be given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
they should lead the way to the dining-room, and sit at the
head of the table, side by side; but if a reception tea is
given, the guests might be sent in at the tea hour&mdash;that is to
say, told that tea is going on, and the bride and bridegroom
could follow later should the numbers be too great to admit
of all going into the tea-room at the same time.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is quite in Order for a Widow to have a
Wedding Cake</big></b>, but it should not be decorated with
orange blossoms or with white flowers, merely with icing
and ornamentations. The display of presents at the
marriage of a widow is, as a rule, a very restricted one.
The bridegroom and the bridegroom's family being the
principal donors, the presents are seldom exhibited. The
exception is when a widow has made many new friends,
and has received wedding presents from them. Presents,
when made to a widow having a house of her own, are
expected to be of substantial value, and there is a general
reluctance felt to offering her trifles, even if expensive ones,
such as a girl-bride would appreciate; not so a married
lady of social standing.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>On arriving at the House</big></b> where the wedding
luncheon or reception is to be held, the gentlemen should
leave their hats in the hall. The ladies should not remove
their bonnets or hats at a wedding luncheon or reception,
neither should the bridesmaids do so.</p>

<p>Gentlemen should take off their gloves at wedding
luncheons, but it is optional whether ladies do so or
not.</p>

<p>At receptions it is optional with both ladies and gentlemen
whether they take off their gloves or not.</p>

<p>The guests who have not already had an opportunity of
speaking to the bride and bridegroom, on being ushered
into the drawing-room, where the company assembles,
should shake hands with them, having first gone through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
that ceremony with the host and hostess, if they have not
already done so.</p>

<p>Previous to luncheon being announced the bride's father
or mother should tell the principal of the gentlemen present
whom to take down to luncheon. But this only applies to
a sit-down luncheon.</p>

<p>At standing-up luncheons the guests are not sent in in
couples, but go in as they please, even two or three ladies
together, and little or no precedency, bridal or otherwise,
is followed as a general rule.</p>

<p>The luncheon should be served in the dining-room,
library, or large marquee, as the case may be.</p>

<p>The bride's mother and the bridegroom's mother should
take precedence of all other ladies present on the occasion
of a wedding luncheon.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>At strictly Family Gatherings the Guests should
go in to Luncheon in the following order</big></b>:&mdash;The
bride and bridegroom. The bride's father with the bridegroom's
mother. The bridegroom's father with the bride's
mother. The best man with the head bridesmaid. The
remaining bridesmaids with the gentlemen who are to take
them in to luncheon.</p>

<p>The rest of the company should follow in the wake of
the bridesmaids. The bride should take the bridegroom's
left arm.</p>

<p>Sitting-down luncheons and standing-up luncheons are
equally fashionable, although the latter are far more general,
and little or no bridal precedency is observed. When a
standing-up luncheon is given, small tables are arranged for
the convenience of the bridal party on one side of the room,
while a long table occupies the centre of the room.</p>

<p>When a sitting-down luncheon is given the bride and
bridegroom should sit either at the head of a long table or
at the centre of it&mdash;the bride at the bridegroom's left hand.
The bride's father should sit next the bride with the bridegroom's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
mother. When the bride and bridegroom sit at
the centre of the table the bridesmaids should sit opposite
to them with the gentlemen who have taken them in to
luncheon; each sitting at a gentleman's right hand.</p>

<p>When the bride and bridegroom occupy the head of the
table, the bridesmaids, with the gentlemen who have taken
them in to luncheon, should place themselves next the
parents on either side of the table, dividing their number
into two groups.</p>

<p>When the bride's father is dead, her eldest brother or
nearest male relative should take his place and should take
the bridegroom's mother in to luncheon.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Wedding Breakfast</big></b> is now termed a luncheon,
champagne and other wines take the place of tea and coffee,
which beverages are not served until towards the end of
the luncheon. At weddings which take place at 2.30 p.m., a
luncheon is frequently given at 3, followed by a "tea" at 4.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Luncheon Menu</big></b> generally comprises soup,
entr&eacute;es both hot and cold; chickens, game, mayonnaises,
salads, jellies, creams, etc., etc., and other dishes of a like
character.</p>

<p>The sweets should be placed on the table, fruit also.</p>

<p>The entr&eacute;es, etc., should be handed by the servants, the
sweets should also be taken off the table by the men-servants
and handed round in turn.</p>

<p>At a standing-up luncheon the gentlemen should help
the ladies and themselves to the various dishes on the
table, as dishes are not handed at this description of
luncheon; hot entr&eacute;es and soup are not given. The menu
is in other respects similar.</p>

<p>The tables should be decorated with flowers at either
a standing-up or a sitting-down luncheon. Bottles of
champagne should be placed the length of the table at a
standing-up luncheon; if not, the gentlemen should ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
servants in attendance for champagne for the ladies they
have taken down, and for themselves. At a sitting-down
luncheon the servants offer champagne to the guests in the
same order in which they hand the dishes.</p>

<p>When the sweets have been handed the bride should cut
the wedding-cake. This she does by merely making the first
incision with a knife; it should then be cut by the butler
into small slices, and handed on dessert plates to the guests.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Health of the Bride and Bridegroom</big></b> should
then be proposed by the most distinguished guest present,
for which the bridegroom should return thanks. He should
then propose the health of the bridesmaids, for which the
best man should return thanks.</p>

<p>Occasionally the gentleman of highest rank present
also proposes this health in place of the bridegroom.</p>

<p>The health of the bride's father and mother should be
proposed by the bridegroom's father.</p>

<p>It is now the custom to confine proposing healths at
wedding luncheons within the narrowest limits. The health
of the bride and bridegroom, and that of the bridesmaids
being, in general, the only healths proposed.</p>

<p>At standing-up luncheons and at wedding receptions, the
health of the bride and bridegroom only is proposed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride should leave the Dining-room</big></b> immediately
after the healths have been drunk, to change her
dress for departure.</p>

<p>The head bridesmaid should accompany her, if related
to her, and the guests should adjourn to the drawing-room
to await the bride's reappearance, which should not be long
delayed, and the adieus should then be made. Leave-takings
should not be prolonged more than is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>The parents should follow the bride and bridegroom
into the hall, and adieus to them should there be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Old-fashioned Custom</big></b> of throwing satin
slippers after the bride is sometimes observed, foolish as it
is. It is the best man's or the head bridesmaid's privilege
to perform this ridiculous act.</p>

<p>When rice is thrown after a bride it should be
scattered by the married and not by the unmarried
ladies present; but the custom, like that of throwing
the so-called "confetti," is now practically obsolete in
good society.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Strewing the Bride's Path with Flowers</big></b> from
the church to the carriage by village children is a custom
much followed at weddings which take place in the country.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Honeymoon</big></b> now seldom lasts longer than a
week or ten days. Many brides prefer spending their
honeymoon in their future home, if it happens to be in the
country, instead of making a hurried trip to Paris or
elsewhere, or to spending it at the country house of a friend,
lent to them for the purpose. But it is entirely a matter of
individual feeling which course is taken.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride's Trousseau</big></b> should be marked with the
initials of the name she is to take.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridegroom should provide</big></b> the house-linen
and all other things appertaining to the bride's new home.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Wedding Presents</big></b> should be dispatched to the
bride's residence immediately after the wedding, and they
should at once be put into their several places, and not
arranged for the purpose of being shown to visitors.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridal Wreath</big></b> should not be worn after the
wedding-day. The bridal wreath, the bridal bouquet, and
the orange blossoms from the wedding-cake, if treasured as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
mementos of the happy event, should be preserved in the
recesses of a locked drawer in the bride's chamber, and not
exhibited under glass shades in the drawing-room.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Precedence</big></b> should not be accorded to a bride during
the first three months after marriage, although this old-fashioned
custom is sometimes followed at country dinner-parties
on the occasion of a bride's first visit.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Custom of sending Wedding Cake</big></b> to friends
is an exploded one, and only followed between near relations.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Wedding Cards</big></b> are, strictly speaking, out of date,
and only sent by people who adhere to old-fashioned customs.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Words "No Cards"</big></b> should not be inserted
when the announcement of a marriage is sent to the newspapers;
neither should the intimation be added that the
bride and bridegroom will be "at home" on certain days.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>WEDDING RECEPTIONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>An Afternoon Wedding</big></b> usually takes place between
2 and 2.30 o'clock, and the "reception" that follows is
given from 2.30 to 5, on the return from the church.</p>

<p>When a wedding is a choral one the choir and clergy
frequently head the bridal procession. This is arranged with
the vicar of the church where the marriage is solemnised.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations</big></b> to wedding receptions are no longer issued
on "at home" cards, but are included in the invitations
to the wedding ceremony issued in printed notes. (See
<a href="#Page_128">Chapter XVI</a>.)</p>

<p>The arrangements in the tea-room, and the refreshments
given, should be similar to those provided at large
afternoon "at homes," with the addition of wedding-cake
and champagne.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Ceremony</big></b> is, as far as possible, dispensed with as
regards sending the guests into the tea-room, and this is
a great advantage gained over a wedding luncheon, either
a sitting-down or a standing-up one, when people are
doubtful as to the exact place belonging to each individual
relative.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom either enter first, followed
by the bridesmaids and a few of the principal guests, or
they follow later, as they prefer. The remainder of the company
should make their way downstairs as space permits,
for a wedding reception is a crowded affair, even in the
largest of mansions. Not only is every one invited who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
has given a wedding present to either bride or bridegroom,
within visiting distance, but even others who are not
intimate enough to be expected to do so.</p>

<p>The guests should not make their way in the first
instance to the tea-room, but should proceed at once to
the drawing-room and shake hands with the host and
hostess, and afterwards with the bride and bridegroom.
The bride and bridegroom should stand together within
the drawing-room and shake hands with all those with
whom they are acquainted. The bride and bridegroom
should be the first to enter the tea-room. Flowers, as a
matter of course, are a great feature at wedding receptions.</p>

<p>The tea and coffee should be served by the maid-servants,
generally by the lady's maids, but men-servants
should also be in attendance to open the champagne as
required. Very little wine is drunk at this hour of the day.
Ladies seldom care for it, and gentlemen avoid it on
principle. Still, out of compliment to the bride, the relatives
quaff a cup of sparkling wine, although her health
is seldom proposed or speeches of any kind made. The
bride should put the knife into the wedding-cake, and the
butler should cut it up and hand it to the guests.</p>

<p>Seats should not be placed in the tea-room, and the
tables should occupy the top or side, or both the top and
side, of the room, according to the number of guests
invited, so as to leave as much space as possible in the
centre of the room.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom are not always present at
a wedding tea, as the departure for the proposed place of
honeymoon does not in every case admit of it, and the
mother holds the "at home," and the guests inspect
the presents after the newly-married couple have left.</p>

<p>An "at home" is sometimes given a few days previous
to the wedding for the inspection of the presents, if they
are very numerous and beautiful; but even when this is
done they still form a centre of interest on the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the wedding to the many guests. When jewellery and
plate to any great extent form a portion of the presents, it
is sometimes thought necessary to have a policeman on duty
while the house is open to so many comers, and when to
effect an entrance under the pretext of business would be
an easy matter.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>WEDDING EXPENSES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>The Responsibilities of a Bridegroom</big></b> from a pecuniary
point of view commence from the moment of his
engagement. He must at once present the bride-elect with
an engagement ring. A man of even moderate wealth finds
no difficulty in choosing and purchasing a handsome ring
costing from &pound;50 to &pound;100; but a poor man, possessing
but a small income, is often put to more expense than he
can conveniently afford in the matter of an engagement
ring. He knows all the members of the bride's family will
sit in judgment upon it if it is but a modest gift worth
about &pound;10, which is quite as much as he feels he is
justified in spending; he knows that both it and himself
will be regarded as very mean, or as conveying a not very
inspiriting prospect of days to come. The engagement
ring worn on the bride's finger after marriage is a lasting
memento, and if a poor one she will not be proud of it&mdash;neither
will he. Rich men take the brides to choose
engagement rings, expense being no object to them; but
poor men cannot do this, as the choice might fall on gems
beyond their means, therefore they make the choice themselves,
according to the position of the families they are
about to enter. If the standing is above their own, from
a money point of view, the engagement rings have to be
chosen in accordance with the jewels worn by members
of such families, and a bridegroom would thus spend &pound;40
at least on an engagement ring suitable to a lady so placed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
On the other hand, when men with small incomes marry
the daughters of parents of a similar position to their own,
the engagement rings given are not costly ones, and a ten-pound
note, or even less, would cover the cost of these
binding tokens. The wedding rings are within the means
of all bridegrooms, be they ever so poor.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>During the Engagement</big></b> the question of presents
to the brides-elect is never absent from the thoughts of
their bridegrooms. The wealthy please themselves and
their brides by giving costly jewels, which are often chosen
by the brides themselves in company with their bridegrooms.
This is very delightful shopping, but it does not
fall to the lot of the great majority. Men of moderate
means give presents of moderate value and few in number;
they are not bound by etiquette during their engagements
to give any jewellery if their incomes do not warrant this
outlay; but a man must have very little money to go upon
if he cannot contrive to give a bracelet or necklet or some
such trinket to the girl he is about to marry.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>To give Presents to the Bridesmaids</big></b> is another
of the obligations of bridegrooms. Here again, the wealthy
exercise their generosity and good taste with the concurrence
of their brides, who assist them in the choice of
suitable presents in articles of jewellery. These average
&pound;5 and upwards for each bridesmaid, which bring it to a
good total when the bridesmaids are numerous. The point
that affects the generosity of bridegrooms, however, is not
how much they ought to spend on these presents, but
rather, how little may be spent upon them with due consideration
for the fitness of things, viz. the position of the
bridesmaids. Two sovereigns would be a reasonable sum
for a man of small means to spend on each gift to the
bridesmaid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridal Bouquet and the Bridesmaids'
Bouquets</big></b> come next on the list of expenses a bridegroom
defrays. Rich men spend liberally in this direction, but
average sums to give to meet ordinary incomes are two
guineas to one guinea for a bride's bouquet, and five and
twenty to fifteen shillings each for the bridesmaids' bouquets.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Fees connected with the Ceremony</big></b> are
strictly the province of the bridegroom to defray. If a
marriage is by licence, he pays the cost, which in town
amounts to &pound;2 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and in the country from &pound;2 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
to &pound;3 3<i>s.</i> The fee to the vicar of the church where the
marriage is to be solemnised varies from &pound;1 1<i>s.</i> to &pound;5 5<i>s.</i>,
oftener &pound;1 1<i>s.</i> than not with the majority of bridegrooms
with moderate incomes, the exception being &pound;5 5<i>s.</i> The
minor fees are very trifling that a bridegroom is expected
to pay. He pays the organist for playing a wedding march
at the conclusion of the service, if it is not a choral one;
the bell-ringers look to him for their fee, as do the vergers,
etc. Thus a bridegroom pays for what is absolutely necessary
at the marriage ceremony only, and very little besides.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a Friend of the Bride or Bridegroom
performs the Ceremony</big></b> or assists at it a fee is not given
to him by the bridegroom, but a present of some kind is
made to him, either in silver plate or by a small cheque,
as circumstances dictate, for railway expenses or otherwise.
It is usual for the bridegroom to do this unless the clergyman
in question is a relative of the bride, when a joint
present is usually given by bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bride's Parents bear a Large Share of the
Wedding Expenses</big></b>, foremost of which is the bride's
trousseau, the cost of this being entirely dependent on position
and income. The dinners and "at homes" given before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the marriage to introduce the bridegroom to the members
of the bride's family are given by the bride's parents. The
wedding reception is given by them, either at their own
residence or at an hotel. As concerns their share of the
expenses connected with the ceremony, it depends upon
whether the wedding is to be a smart one or a quiet one. If
the former, the expenses that fall to them are somewhat
considerable; if the latter, they are almost nil. A choral
service, for instance, is paid for by the bride's parents, the
organist, choirmaster, and choir all being severally paid by
them. If the hymns sung are printed on leaflets this trifling
expense also is included. All floral decorations are paid
for by the bride's parents, as is the hire of the awning and
the red felt at the church doors. When wedding favours or
button-holes are given it is by them also.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For whom the Bride's Family are expected to
provide Conveyances is invariably a Misunderstood
Detail.</big></b>&mdash;The bride's father has only to provide carriages
or cars to convey himself and bride to the church, and for
those members of his family residing under his roof, and
for visitors staying with him for the wedding. He is not
required to provide them for any other of the guests, save
in the country, and then only for those who arrive by train
at a roadside station and cannot obtain conveyances for
themselves. In town the bridegroom has to provide the
motor-car to convey himself and bride from the church to her
father's house, and afterwards to the station. In the country
the reverse is the case, and the bride's father does this by
lending one of his own carriages or cars for the purpose.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Bridegroom is expected to provide the
Furniture</big></b> and all household effects for the new home,
including plate and linen, which latter naturally form very
important items. Many of the bridal presents, however
are made to lighten these expenses, and consist of plate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a great extent, and occasionally of linen also, from the
members of the bride's family; still, the rule in England is
that the bridegroom should provide it as part of the necessaries
of the home, and the gift of it by relatives is altogether
optional.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>AFTERNOON "AT HOMES"</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Afternoon "At Homes"</big></b> are a great feature amongst
the entertainments of the day, large afternoon parties, and
small afternoon parties; parties so large that the number
of guests equals those at a big crush or evening reception,
and so small that they might fairly come under the denomination
of afternoon teas.</p>

<p>At afternoon "at homes," ladies are present in a
considerable majority, there being usually from about ten
gentlemen to thirty ladies on an average present at these
gatherings. Ladies have a decided partiality for this class
of entertainment, as it affords an opportunity for meeting
their friends and acquaintances, or for making new
acquaintances, and for forming future plans and interchanging
civilities; and even in the height of the London
season, afternoon "at homes" are fully attended by the
members of the fashionable world.</p>

<p>There are various classes of afternoon "at homes":
the large "at home" of from fifty to two hundred guests,
when usually professional vocal and instrumental talent is
engaged, and fairly good music given, although the entertainment
is not of sufficient importance to be termed a
concert; the "at home" of from fifty to a hundred guests
when only amateur talent is in requisition; and the small
"at home" of from ten to thirty people, when conversation
usually takes the place of music, the party being composed
of friends rather than of acquaintances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations to "At Homes"</big></b> should be issued in the
name of the hostess only, and not in the united names of
the master and mistress of the house.</p>

<p>Invitations should be issued on "at home" cards, large
and small, and also on visiting cards. The name of the
person invited should be written at the top of the card at
the right-hand corner, the words "at home" being printed
beneath the name of the lady issuing the invitation, and the
day and date beneath the words "at home," and the hour
beneath the date. Any amusement to be given should be
added at the bottom of the card at the left-hand corner.
The address should be printed at the right-hand corner at
the bottom of the card.</p>

<p>The letters R.S.V.P. are occasionally either written
or printed on the "at home" card, at the left-hand corner
of the bottom of the card, but it is not usual to write
"R.S.V.P." in the corner of an afternoon "at home"
card, as it is immaterial how many guests are present at
this class of entertainment; but if an answer is so requested,
an answer should be sent. R.S.V.P. signifies "<i>r&eacute;pondez,
s'il vous pla&icirc;t</i>" or "an answer is requested."</p>

<p>It is customary to include the head of the family, either
husband or father, in the invitation. Thus, at the top of
the card, at the right-hand corner should be written "Mr.
and Mrs. A.," or "Mr. and Miss A." The daughters of the
house should be included in the invitation sent to their
mother. Thus "Mr. and Mrs. A.," "The Misses A.," but
the sons of the house should be invited separately.</p>

<p>When a family consists of a mother and daughters, the
invitation should be "Mrs. and the Misses A."</p>

<p>The title of "Honourable" should not be put on an
invitation card, but only on the envelope containing the
card.</p>

<p>All other titles are recognised on invitation cards; but
the letters K.C.B., M.P., etc., should not be written on the
cards, but only on the envelopes in which they are enclosed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>If a lady is aware that she will be unable to be present,
it would be polite to send her excuses, although strict
etiquette does not demand it; both the invitation and the
answer can in all cases be sent by post.</p>

<p>It is not now considered necessary to leave cards after
afternoon "at homes."</p>

<p>Invitations to large afternoon "at homes" should be
issued a fortnight previous to the day, and to small "at
homes" within a week or so of the day.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Arrival of Guests.</big></b>&mdash;When invited guests arrive,
they should not inquire if the hostess is at home, but at
once enter the house; and they should be ushered at once
into the tea-room.</p>

<p>The gentlemen should leave their hats and overcoats in
the hall.</p>

<p>At large "at homes" a cloak-room should be provided,
so that a lady could remove a cloak or fur-cape, usually
worn during the winter weather; but at small "at homes"
a cloak-room is not necessary, as the reception-rooms are
neither so crowded nor so warm, neither are the ladies'
toilettes so elaborate.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Refreshments.</big></b>&mdash;At large "at homes" refreshments
should be served in the dining-room, on a long buffet at
one end of the room, or on a long table the length of the
room.</p>

<p>The lady's-maids and other maid-servants should stand
behind the table to pour out and hand the cups of tea or
coffee across the table as asked for.</p>

<p>It is usual to have women-servants on these occasions
to pour out the tea, a man-servant or men-servants being
also in attendance, in case anything is required of them,
although gentlemen usually help themselves to claret-cup,
wine, etc.</p>

<p>The usual refreshments given at these "at homes" are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
tea and coffee, the latter served from large silver urns.
(See chapter "Preparing Afternoon Tea," in the work
entitled "Waiting at Table.") Sherry, champagne-cup,
claret-cup, ices, fruit, fancy biscuits and cakes, thin bread-and-butter,
potted game, sandwiches, etc.</p>

<p>Ice plates are used for ices, dessert plates for fruit and
fruit salads.</p>

<p>At small "at homes" champagne, claret-cup, and ices
are not given. The tea should be made in teapots, instead
of in urns, at both large and small "at homes."</p>

<p>At small "at homes" the tea is usually served in the
smaller of the two drawing-rooms, or in an adjoining
boudoir or ante-room. The tea is then poured out by the
young ladies of the house, or by the hostess herself, but
seldom by maid-servants when served in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The most convenient manner, however, of serving tea
is to serve it in the dining-room, unless the number of
guests is limited, when it would appear unsociable if they
were to congregate in the dining-room, leaving the hostess
comparatively alone in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>When tea is served in the dining-room, the guests are
usually asked by the servant in attendance if they will have
tea before being ushered into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>At small teas, the cups of tea should be handed to the
ladies by the gentlemen present, or by the young lady
officiating at the tea-table, and gentlemen generally stand
about the room, or near the tea-table, at small "at homes."</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Receiving Guests.</big></b>&mdash;The servant should precede the
guests to the drawing-room as in "morning calls."</p>

<p>At large "at homes" the hostess should receive her
guests at the drawing-room door, and shake hands with
each on arrival. The drawing-room door should remain
open, and she should stand within the doorway.</p>

<p>At small teas, the drawing-room door should not remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
open, and the hostess should receive her guests within the
room, as at "morning calls."</p>

<p>The guests should arrive from a quarter-past four until
half-past five or six o'clock. The guests are not expected to
remain the whole three hours specified, and are at liberty
to remain as long or as short a time as they please. The
earliest arrivals are generally the first to leave.</p>

<p>When the hostess judges it expedient to do so, she introduces
one or two of the ladies to each other, either in a
formal manner (see <a href="#Page_6">Chapter II</a>.), or in a semi-formal
manner, by saying, "Mrs. A., I don't think you know
Mrs. B."; but she should not say this unless quite certain
that Mrs. B. desires the acquaintance of Mrs. A., or that
Mrs. A. has no objection to knowing Mrs. B.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It is rather the exception than the rule to make general
introductions on these occasions. Introductions should
only be made when the hostess is aware that the persons
introduced would be likely to appreciate each other, or for
any reason of equal weight.</p>

<p>The guests should go to the tea-room with any gentlemen
of their acquaintance present, or in the case of ladies
with each other, if they have not done so on arrival.</p>

<p>This move to the tea-room is usually made in the
intervals between music, recitations, etc.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the hostess introduces one or two of the
gentlemen present to the ladies of highest rank for the
purpose of sending them into the tea-room.</p>

<p>A lady should place her empty cup on any table near at
hand, unless a gentleman offers to put it down for her. It
is optional whether a lady removes her gloves or not, and
many prefer not to do so.</p>

<p>At large "at homes," the hostess remains at her post the
whole of the time, and hardly ever sits down. At small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
"at homes," she should move amongst her guests, conversing
with them all more or less. When there are daughters, they
should assist their mother in entertaining the guests.</p>

<p>When ladies are acquainted, they should take an opportunity
of speaking to each other. It is usual for ladies to
move about the rooms at afternoon "at homes" to speak
to their various friends and acquaintances; and they are
by no means obliged to remain seated in one spot unless
desirous of doing so.</p>

<p>When music is given at afternoon "at homes," it is usual
to listen to the performance, or at least to appear to do so;
and if conversation is carried on, it should be in a low tone,
so as not to disturb or annoy the performers.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to take leave of the hostess at afternoon
"at homes," unless she is standing near the drawing-room
door when the guest is passing out, or unless she is a
new acquaintance, and the visit a first one at her house,
when it would be polite to do so.</p>

<p>When it is late, and but a few guests still remain, these
few should make their adieus to the hostess.</p>

<p>At these afternoon teas or "at homes," the hostess should
not ring to order the door to be opened for the departing
guest or for her motor-car to be called, as at "morning calls."
The guests make their way to the hall, and the servants in
attendance call up the motor-cars as they are asked for.</p>

<p>Motor-cars should always be kept in waiting at afternoon
"at homes," as ladies are sometimes unable to remain
longer than a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>The guests either remain in the hall or in the dining-room
until they hear their motor-cars are announced.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gratuities</big></b> should never be offered to servants at these
entertainments, or, in fact, at any entertainment whatever.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Afternoon Concerts.</big></b>&mdash;When afternoon concerts are
given, invitations should be issued on the usual "at home"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cards, which can be purchased with the words "at home,"
etc., already printed, or they are printed to order, with the
name and address of the hostess. The name of the person
invited should be written above the name of the hostess at
the right-hand corner of the card.</p>

<p>The date under the line "at home" should be in
the centre of the card beneath the name of the hostess;
the hour should be written at the left-hand corner, and the
letters R.S.V.P. The printed address should be at the
right-hand corner.</p>

<p>The names of the performers should be added at the
bottom of the card at the right-hand corner.</p>

<p>The hour usually fixed for a concert is 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>The hostess should receive her guests at the drawing-room
door, when they should at once seat themselves.
The seats should be arranged in rows down the centre
of the room, and sofas and settees should be placed around
the room.</p>

<p>The programme of a concert is divided into two parts,
and at the conclusion of the first part the guests should
repair to the dining-room for refreshments, which are served
as at large "at homes."</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Afternoon Dances.</big></b>&mdash;Invitations to afternoon dances
should be issued on "at home" cards in the manner already
described. "Dancing" should be printed in the corner of
cards, and the hour of "4 to 7" o'clock substituted for
that of "3" o'clock. The words "afternoon dance" should
not be written on an invitation card, and there is no other
received form of invitation for afternoon dances than the
one already given.</p>

<p>Afternoon dances are very popular at watering-places,
military stations, small towns in the vicinity of London,
etc., but are seldom given in London itself.</p>

<p>Refreshments should be served during the whole of the
afternoon, from 4 to 7, as at large "at homes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The ladies should remove their jackets or wraps in the
cloak-room, but retain their hats or bonnets; the hostess
should receive her guests at the drawing-room door, as at
an afternoon "at home."</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Bridge Teas</big></b> occupy an important place in social life.
They are a convenient form of entertainment, as they allow
of a small number of guests being invited, even as few
as eight persons being considered a reasonable number of
players to invite, while twenty-four is distinctly an outside
one. The average number is in most instances sixteen,
all told.</p>

<p>The play usually commences at 3.30, sometimes earlier,
and continues until 7.30, allowing an interval for "tea"
at 4.30.</p>

<p>The invitations to these informal gatherings are either
issued in friendly notes or on visiting cards. If on the
latter, the words "at home," day, and date are written
under the name of the hostess, while "Bridge, 3.30," or
"3 o'clock" is put in the corner of the cards opposite
the address.</p>

<p>The hostess arranges beforehand the places the guests
are to occupy at the different tables; this is done that the
good players may play together. When all have arrived,
the hostess tells her guests where to sit, and is herself one
of the players. On taking their seats they cut for partners.
She does not invite guests to look on, as it would necessitate
her not playing, but talking to them while they remain;
besides conversation is discouraged, as it distracts the
attention of the players from the game.</p>

<p>The ladies retain their hats, but remove their coats,
furs, etc., on arrival.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>"AT HOME" DAYS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>An "At Home"</big></b> day signifies that a lady is at home to
her friends and acquaintances on one particular day in the
week. She should intimate this fact by printing upon her
visiting cards the days on which she is at home. Thus:
"Thursdays in March," or "Thursdays in March and April,"
or any day of the week she thinks proper to name. These
cards she should leave in person on those who are not at
home when she calls, or they can be sent by post. Those
she finds at home she should inform that her "at home"
day is "Thursday." She should not leave her visiting card
in this case, only two of her husband's cards, and the "at
home" day should not be written upon them.</p>

<p>On the "at home" day, calls should be made from three
to six, or from four to six. The first comers should leave
before the afternoon tea hour and should limit their call
according to the degree of intimacy existing, remaining from
a quarter of an hour to an hour, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Hostess or her Daughter should pour out the
Tea</big></b> on these "at home" days when tea is not served in
the dining-room as at "at homes," which should be done
when the number of visitors is very considerable.</p>

<p>The popularity of a hostess is tested on these "at home"
days by the number of visitors who call during the afternoon,
and when "at home" days are not a success, socially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
speaking, she should discontinue them after a certain time,
and should substitute an occasional "at home."</p>

<p>It depends not a little on the social standing of the
lady who has an "at home" day and upon the locality in
which she lives, as to whether the "at home" day is a
failure or the reverse. In the outlying districts of town it
has its advantages, when to make a call amounts to almost
a journey, and when acquaintances are few in the immediate
neighbourhood. Again, it has its advantages when ladies
are much occupied during the week, and when their time
is given up to an engrossing occupation, charitable or
artistic, at home or away from home, literary or scientific,
at studios, museums and public institutions, etc., work undertaken
for their own amusement, profit, or advancement, or
for the benefit of others. To these ladies an "at home"
day is a convenience. One day in the week is all they can
allow themselves apart from their important engagements,
and to them quiet privacy and leisure are indispensable.
Fashionable ladies consider an "at home" day to be a
great tax upon their time and inclinations. Their engagements
are too numerous to admit of giving up one whole
afternoon in every week on the chance of people calling.
Not only long-standing but impromptu engagements preclude
this sacrifice. It would be a breach of politeness not
to be at home to callers on an "at home" day, and many
things might occur to necessitate absence from home on
that particular afternoon. If, however, absence is unavoidable,
a relative might take the place of the hostess on the
"at home" day in question.</p>

<p>The people who thoroughly enjoy "at home" days are
those who have more time on their hands than they know
what to do with. The few calls they have to make are soon
made, the few friends they have to see are soon seen,
occupation they have none, and they are grateful for the
opportunity "at home" days offer of meeting their friends
and finding a hostess at home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>COLONIAL ETIQUETTE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Generally</span> speaking, etiquette is followed in the colonies
and in India by English men and women very much as in
the mother country as regards its principles, rules, and
observances. One marked difference occurs in the hours
of calling, it is true, they being regulated by climate. In
hot climates, the early morning hours, before noon, and
late evening hours, after sunset, are, according to the
fashion of the place, the chosen hours for calling; but in
more temperate climes&mdash;resembling our own&mdash;the afternoon
hours are, as with us, the hours for calling. Again, the
rule that residents should call upon new-comers, whether
they be visitors of other residents or intending residents,
holds equally good both in civilian and military circles
alike.</p>

<p>In all colonies and dependencies "Government House"
is the centre to which all society gravitates&mdash;that is to say,
that all new-comers, whether they are to become permanent
or temporary residents, providing their social position
warrants the action, hasten to make known their arrival by
writing their names and addresses in the visitors' book kept
at each Government House for the purpose. The object
of doing this is to be received at Government House, and
thus to obtain an entrance into the society of the place.
What follows upon this social observance&mdash;it hardly merits
the name of civility, such calls being actuated by self-interest
in the first instance&mdash;depends upon a variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
circumstances, the position of the caller, and whether the
stay is to be permanent or temporary, whether introductions
are brought or not, and so on. The invitations extended to
them are regulated accordingly. They may be limited to
afternoon "at homes"; or receptions, dinners, and dances
may be included; or a visit to the summer residence of the
Governor and his wife may also be reckoned amongst
invitations, as this latter is not an unusual display of
hospitality accorded to certain individuals.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>How the Governor of a Colony should be
addressed</big></b> by his guests depends upon his rank. As he
represents the sovereign, it would be quite correct to address
him as "Sir," as being the most deferential mode, and
Governors as a body rather like to be thus addressed. In
the case of a Governor being a knight&mdash;a very usual contingency&mdash;it
would be equally correct to address him as
"Sir George," and not as "Sir." When a Governor has
not received knighthood, he should be addressed as "Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;,"
when it is not desired to be too stiff and formal.</p>

<p>In conversation, when referring to the Governor&mdash;he
being present&mdash;it should not be "The Governor," but
"Lord Blank," "Sir George," or "Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; said so and
so," unless strangers are present, before whom it would
seem right to be a little formal.</p>

<p>In addressing a Governor by letter, the envelope should
be directed to "His Excellency Sir George Blank," however
friendly its contents may be; but when writing to a
Governor's wife, it has not been thought right to style her
"Her Excellency," but simply "Lady Blank," unless in the
case of a Viceroy's wife, as in India or Ireland; but as
against this the point was raised some years ago, and it was
then decided that the wives of Governors were entitled to
be so addressed.</p>

<p>Colloquially, the members of a Governor's suite refer
to both the Governor and his wife as "His" and "Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Excellency," and style them "Your Excellency," and all
who approach them officially, being of inferior rank, do
likewise; but socially they are seldom so addressed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Colonial Bishop</big></b> should not actually be styled "My
Lord," or referred to as "The Lord Bishop," if it is desired
to be quite correct; but "My Lord" or "The Lord Bishop"
is now often used by persons who know it is not the proper
style of address, but make use of these titles, wishing to be
more deferential than scrupulously correct. In writing to
a colonial bishop, the envelope should be addressed to
"The Right Rev. the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;," and the letter commenced
"Right Rev. Sir" or "Dear Bishop Blank."</p>

<p>A colonial officer who has received the King's special
permission to retain the title of "Honourable" which he
bore in his colony, is accorded at Court, <i>i.e.</i> at a lev&eacute;e,
Court ball, etc., the same precedence as a peer's son, who
is styled "Honourable," but this does not practically give
him any rank or precedence at ordinary social gatherings,
where that special grant is unknown or ignored. Also the
privilege confers no rank or precedence upon the wife or
daughters of a colonial Honourable, just as the wife of a
Right Honourable here has no special precedence.</p>

<p>The title of Honourable cannot continue to be borne
by a retired colonial officer or Legislative Councillor unless
it has been specially authorised by the sovereign on the
recommendation of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>INDIAN ETIQUETTE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> is the custom that those who wish to be invited to
Government House (Viceregal House) at Simla, or elsewhere,
should, immediately on arrival, write their names in
the visitors' book kept for that purpose, and they are sure,
if in general society, to be asked to one or more of the
receptions held during the season. They are introduced
to the Vice-Queen&mdash;as the wife of the Viceroy is termed&mdash;by
one of the <i>aides-de-camp</i> in waiting.</p>

<p>When a lady is the wife of a Government official, it
gives her a position in society in India which perhaps she
would not otherwise have, and is in itself a passport to most
functions. Official rank is everything in India.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards attending the Viceregal Drawing-rooms</big></b>,
they are only held in Calcutta and in the evening.
If a lady has been presented at a Court in England, she can
attend a Drawing-room in Calcutta; but, if she has not been
presented at home, she must be introduced by some other
lady who has been presented at the Viceregal Court.</p>

<p>In writing unofficially to the Governor-General of India,
it would not be correct to use the title of "Viceroy," and
the proper superscription is "His Excellency The Right
Hon."; or, if a Duke, "His Excellency The Duke of &mdash;&mdash;";
or, if a Marquis, "His Excellency The Most Honble.
Marquis of &mdash;&mdash;," etc.</p>

<p>To the wife of a Viceroy the address should be "Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Excellency the Duchess of &mdash;&mdash;," "Her Excellency The
Marchioness of &mdash;&mdash;," "Her Excellency The Countess of &mdash;&mdash;";
or "Her Excellency The Lady Blank," if the wife
of a Baron.</p>

<p>When addressing a Viceroy or Vice-Queen colloquially
or unofficially, "Your Excellency" should not be used in
either case. The title only in both instances should be
employed.</p>

<p>On being introduced to either of their Excellencies, it
would be correct to curtsy.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>GARDEN-PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Garden-parties</span> are entertainments that are annually given.
If the weather is fine, the more enjoyable it is for the
guests; if wet, a garden-party resolves itself into a large
"at home." In almost every county a series of garden-parties
is held by the principal ladies of their respective
neighbourhoods during August and September, nothing but
absence from home, illness, or some equally good reason
being considered sufficient excuse for the non-fulfilment of
this social duty.</p>

<p>The county at large expects to be invited at least once
a year to roam about in the beautiful park of the lord
of the manor, to row on the lake, to play lawn-tennis on
the lawn, to wander through the winding paths of the
shady, leafy shrubberies, to admire the brilliant hues of
the geraniums bedded out on parterre and terrace, or the
variegated asters, or the late Gloire-de-Dijon roses, which
at the end of August are in their fullest beauty. Then
there are the conservatories through which to saunter, and
from which to beat a retreat, if the sun is too powerful,
into the mansion itself, the reception-rooms being generally
thrown open on the occasion of a garden-party.</p>

<p>A garden-party is an occasion for offering hospitality to
a wide range of guests&mdash;people whom it would not be
convenient to entertain save at this description of gathering.
Invitations are on these occasions freely accorded to ladies,
from the energetic lady of eighty to the little lady of eight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>One great advantage offered by a garden-party is that
it is immaterial to what extent ladies are in the majority,
and it is a reproach to a county rather than to a hostess
if the muster of guests is eighty ladies against twenty
gentlemen.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations to a Garden-party</big></b> should be issued in
the name of the hostess, and within three weeks to a week
of the date fixed. "At home" cards should be used for
this purpose, and the words "and party" should be invariably
added after the names of the invited guests.</p>

<p>"Croquet" or "Tennis" should be printed in one corner
of the card, the hour, 3 to 7 o'clock, above, the day and the
date beneath the name of hostess. "Weather permitting"
is seldom written upon the card, and the guests are expected
to arrive even though the afternoon should be showery and
overcast, and only a thoroughly wet afternoon, with no break
between the showers, should prevent their appearing. In
the country, ladies think little of a drive of ten miles to
attend a garden-party.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Arrangements for Garden-Parties.</big></b>&mdash;Garden-parties
or croquet-parties are given on different scales of
expenditure, and the preparations are regulated accordingly.</p>

<p>When a garden-party is given on a small scale, and the
preparations are comparatively few, refreshments should be
served in the house. (For the usual refreshments provided,
and for the general arrangements, see work entitled "Waiting
at Table," p. 82.)</p>

<p>A good supply of garden-chairs and seats should be
placed on the lawn and about the grounds, rugs spread on
the grass for those who sit out, and several sets of croquet
provided for players.</p>

<p>At large garden-parties a band is considered a necessary
adjunct, and the band of the regiment quartered in the
vicinity is usually available for these occasions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>A band gives <i>&eacute;clat</i> to an out-door gathering and confers
local importance upon it. Apart from this, the strains of a
band enliven an entertainment of this description in no
little degree. The place where the band is stationed is a
rallying-point for the company, and the expense and trouble
consequent upon engaging a band are repaid by the amusement
it affords.</p>

<p>The matter of engaging a military band is generally
undertaken by the master of the house, rather than by the
mistress, as, in the first place, the consent of the colonel of
the regiment has to be obtained as a matter of form and
courtesy before the arrangements are completed with the
bandmaster.</p>

<p>Conveyance for the band has also to be provided and
discussed with the bandmaster, and also refreshments for
the bandsmen; and these details are more effectually carried
out by a host than by a hostess.</p>

<p>Occasionally a large marquee is erected in which to serve
refreshments, but more frequently the refreshments for the
general company are served in the house, and only cool
drinks dispensed in a tent to the cricketers or lawn-tennis
players.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Cricket-matches</big></b> are often the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of a
garden-party, rendering it popular with both ladies and
gentlemen. The cricket-match in this case generally takes
place in a field near to the grounds of the mansion, the
match commencing about twelve o'clock, and the general
company arriving about half-past three, or punctually at
four, to witness the finish.</p>

<p>Golf now ranks first amongst fashionable out-door
amusements with both sexes. Private links are comparatively
few, but club links exist in almost every neighbourhood&mdash;ladies'
clubs, men's clubs, and clubs for both ladies
and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Croquet or tennis tournaments are frequently the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of giving garden-parties, and some very exciting play takes
place.</p>

<p>When a tournament is held it takes the form of a
garden-party; it usually lasts two days. The arrangements
made for holding it depend upon circumstances, and it
takes place, as do archery-matches, in either private or
public grounds.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Amusements.</big></b>&mdash;When a number of children are expected
at a garden-party, performances of marionettes, or
Punch-and-Judy, or conjuring are given for their amusement.</p>

<p>In districts remote from town, these shows are difficult
to obtain; therefore amateur showmen come bravely to the
rescue, and their kindly efforts to divert the juveniles meet
with due appreciation on all sides.</p>

<p>Not seldom a little amateur music is given at a garden-party&mdash;not
a pre-arranged programme of music, but impromptu
performances. These good-natured efforts to
enliven the company occupy about an hour, and such performances
take place in either the drawing-room or music-room
of the mansion.</p>

<p>Garden-parties seldom terminate with a dance, though
occasionally dancing closes the afternoon's amusements.</p>

<p>The time occupied by croquet or tennis precludes all
desire on the part of the players for further exertion in the
shape of dancing, and young people apparently prefer playing
croquet from 3 to 7 on the lawn to dancing in a
marquee or in the drawing-room at that hour.</p>

<p>A host and hostess receive their guests at a garden-party
on the lawn; strangers should be introduced to the hostess
by those who have undertaken to bring them to her house,
and she should shake hands with all comers. It is also
usual for guests to shake hands with the hostess on departure,
if opportunity offers for so doing.</p>

<p>Garden-parties commence from 3.30 to 4 o'clock, and
terminate at 7 o'clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>In making preparations for a garden-party, stabling for
the carriage-horses and motor-cars of the numerous guests
should be taken into consideration, and refreshments provided
for the men-servants and chauffeurs.</p>

<p>Public afternoon concerts, bazaars, and flower-shows
are essentially functions frequented by ladies <i>en masse</i>, and
it is the exception, rather than the rule, for gentlemen to
accompany them; again, at private afternoon gatherings,
ladies usually appear unaccompanied by gentlemen.</p>

<p>When a garden-party is a very large function, it is not
unusual to put the words "garden-party" on the invitation
cards in place of the words "at home"; thus: "The
Countess of A&mdash;&mdash; requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs.
B&mdash;&mdash;'s company at a garden-party on &mdash;&mdash;," etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>TOWN GARDEN-PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> first garden-parties in town are usually given early
in June, and continue during this and the ensuing month.
The garden-parties at Lambeth Palace and Fulham Palace
are the pioneers of the garden-party season, and the lead
is followed by general society with more or less alacrity.</p>

<p>Town garden-parties resolve themselves into large
receptions held out-of-doors, and those who know what
crowded drawing-rooms imply in the sultry days of June
are particularly glad of this change of <i>locale</i>, and willingly
spend an hour or more at one of these out-of-door <i>reunions</i>,
instead of thinking a quarter of an hour's stay all too long
within doors, where it is a case of heat <i>versus</i> draught, and
difficult to determine where it is the most objectionable, in
the drawing-room, tea-room, or on a staircase. Although
these functions are designated "garden-parties," yet the real
style and title is "at homes," the address being sufficient
indication to the invited guests as to the description of
entertainment to be given, as the spacious gardens and
lawns in and around London where these annual parties
are held are well known to society at large. A band playing
in the grounds where the garden-party is given would
appear to be a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>, but the excellence of the same
is merely a question of expense. Thus guests have the
pleasure of listening to the strains of splendid bands, and
also the disappointment of hearing others far below the
average.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>As this fickle climate of ours is not to be counted upon
for twenty-four hours at a stretch to remain fine, it is
seldom considered advisable to have the whole of the
refreshment tables out-of-doors, and thus only ices, strawberries
and cream, and ice cups are served out-of-doors;
tea, coffee, and the rest, with ices, strawberries and cream,
being invariably served within doors.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Refreshment tables out-of-doors</big></b> considerably take
off the strain from the tables in the tea-rooms, especially
during the first half-hour, when the great rush is made in this
direction. Again, should heavy rain set in, the servants can
easily remove pails of ice and bowls of strawberries and
cream out of harm's way. Even a large tent or marquee
is not considered altogether desirable for refreshments, as
under a burning sun the air within becomes over-heated and
oppressive, while in the case of a downpour the results are
almost disastrous.</p>

<p>The popularity of garden-parties is incontestible in
propitious weather. A variety of reasons conduce to this;
for one thing, movement is so pleasant an exchange from
the almost stationary position guests are compelled to take
up in a crowded drawing-room. Again, the number of
guests invited is so much greater than to an "at home,"
that the chance of meeting a corresponding number of
friends and acquaintances is trebled; or, on the other
hand, if but a few friends should be present among the
guests, yet the situation does not amount to isolation and
boredom; and the alternative of sitting under a shady
tree or sauntering about on the lawns listening to the
strains of the band, is positive enjoyment in comparison
to sitting in the corner of a drawing-room barricaded by
a phalanx of ladies, or standing wedged in the midst
of the same. It is small wonder, therefore, that invitations
to these out-door functions are hailed with satisfaction and
pleasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Arrivals at a garden-party</big></b> are made almost simultaneously,
or if not quite this, they follow in rapid succession,
so that host and hostess have a short interval between
arrivals and departures; and this offers an opportunity to
give more than a shake of the hand to many of the guests,
<i>i.e.</i> a little friendly conversation; while at an "at home"
the hostess has to be at her post from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., as
guests arrive continuously, even close up to the hour named
for departure.</p>

<p>The host is expected to be present at a garden-party,
and almost always is so; but his presence at his wife's "at
home" is left a little doubtful, and his absence is often
accounted for on the ground of its being unavoidable; but
the trivial reasons that many men advance to their wives
for their non-appearance prove how glad they are to escape
from the ordeal on any terms. A man in the open air is
at his best, and therefore a garden-party appeals to a host
almost as much as it does to a guest.</p>

<p>Although the words "at home" are in general use when
issuing invitations to these functions, yet occasionally the
words "garden-party" are substituted in lieu of them on
the "at home" cards, when the gatherings are unusually
large; thus: "Viscountess B&mdash;&mdash; requests the pleasure of
Mr. and Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;'s company at a garden-party on &mdash;&mdash;," etc.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>EVENING GARDEN-PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>The Garden-Party Season</big></b> has been widened out by
the introduction of "Evening Garden-Parties" into the list
of country festivities, and this form of entertainment has
found great favour with all.</p>

<p>Invitations are issued on the usual "at home" cards,
the hours from 9 to 12 p.m. Occasionally "dancing" is
printed on the cards, but not often, as it is not usual to
combine an evening garden-party with a dance, except
when only young girls and young men are invited.</p>

<p>Some little perplexity is felt by the recipients of evening
garden-party invitations as to the style of dress that should
be worn. Should ladies wear morning dress or evening
dress? Men are equally in doubt on this point. Ought
they to wear evening dress or not? Although this is not
stated on the invitation cards, yet it is tacitly understood
that ladies are expected to appear in the usual garden-party
attire&mdash;smart, pretty dresses and hats or bonnets, and
small fashionable wraps carried in place of sunshades in the
event of the evening air proving somewhat chilly. Evening
dress, when worn at one of these "at homes," looks
particularly out of place. The thin evening shoes, which
must of necessity be worn with this style of dress, suit
neither dewy grass nor stony gravel; and although at the
evening concerts at the Botanic Gardens many ladies wear
"evening dress" with smart evening cloaks, this is beside
the question. They go for a short half-hour or so, not for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
three hours' stay. Anyhow, at evening garden-parties, the
rule is not to wear evening dress as far as ladies are concerned.
Men, on the other hand, one and all, are expected
to do so, morning dress being looked upon as out of place
on these occasions. A light overcoat is inseparable from
evening dress, therefore it is not considered risky wear for
men even on the chilliest of summer evenings.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As to the arrangements</big></b> for one of these evening
garden-parties. It is usual to have tea and coffee, and light
refreshments during the whole of the evening, from arrival
to departure, and to give a light supper a little before
twelve o'clock. The gardens and grounds are illuminated
with coloured lamps and lanterns, extensively or moderately,
as the case may be. A band is considered indispensable,
but a good one does not seem to be equally imperative, to
judge from the indifferent performances of various bands
heard on these summer evenings. However, country
audiences are not too critical, knowing that to engage a
good band from a distance entails considerable expense,
and that evening garden-parties would be singularly few
if superior music was insisted upon. Thus the local band
is encouraged to do its best, and to allow long intervals to
elapse between each selection.</p>

<p>In the case of an evening turning out decidedly wet,
guests invited from a distance seldom put in an appearance,
while the nearer neighbours do so, and the evening garden-party
becomes an evening reception within doors, shorn of
its numbers, it is true, but a pleasant gathering, nevertheless,
especially with those who know how to make the best of a
<i>contretemps</i> caused by unpropitious weather.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>LUNCHEONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Invitations to Luncheon</big></b> are very much the order of
the day in fashionable society. Those who look back some
few years remark the importance now accorded to this mid-day
meal, and contrast it with the past. The lateness of
the dinner-hour in a measure accounts for the position now
taken by luncheon in the day's programme, joined to the
fact that it offers another opportunity for social gatherings;
and as the prevailing idea seems to be to crowd into one
day as much amusement and variety and change as possible,
invitations to luncheon have become one of the features of
social life.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations to Public Luncheons</big></b> are not now confined
to the celebration of local and civic events, but take a
far wider range, and are given on every available opportunity
when the occasion can be made to serve for assembling a
large party of ladies and gentlemen. Luncheon is by some
considered to be rather a lady's meal than not, although in
reality invitations are given as frequently to the one sex as
to the other. Yet the predominance of ladies at luncheon
is due to the fact that the majority of gentlemen are too
much occupied at this hour to be at liberty to accept invitations
to luncheon, while others, more idle, breakfast at so
late an hour that to them a two o'clock luncheon is a
farce as far as eating is concerned. Outside of those
who are busy men and those who are idle men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
consequently late risers, there is another semi-occupied
class of men who are always amenable to an invitation to
luncheon.</p>

<p>This institution of luncheon is invaluable to people who
have many friends, acquaintances, and relations to entertain,
as invitations to this meal are given for every day in the
week, with or without ceremony, with long notice or short
notice, or on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>Ladies enjoy the society of their hostess at luncheon far
more than at a dinner-party. At the former meal she makes
general conversation with her guests on both sides of the
table; at the latter she is monopolised by her immediate
neighbours, by the gentleman who takes her down to dinner,
and by the one who sits at her right hand, while she leaves
her guests to be entertained by the gentlemen who take
them in to dinner. At luncheon things are different; there
is no going in to luncheon, conventionally speaking, save
on official and public occasions.</p>

<p>Luncheon occupies a prominent place in the round of
hospitalities. Invitations to luncheon are not formally
issued on invitation cards, unless some especial reason
exists for giving a large luncheon-party, in which case it
takes rank as an entertainment.</p>

<p>Large luncheon-parties are given on occasions such as
lawn-tennis tournaments and lawn-tennis parties, archery-parties,
cricket-matches and bazaars, etc.</p>

<p>Semi-official luncheons are given on the occasion of
laying the foundation-stone of a church or public building,
etc. This class of luncheon is beside the question, as it
is rather a banquet than a luncheon, for which printed cards
of invitation are issued.</p>

<p>In general society invitations to luncheon are issued
by written notes or are verbally given according to circumstances.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Invitations to Luncheon.</big></b>&mdash;A week's notice is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
longest usually given, very little notice being considered
requisite.</p>

<p>Many hostesses give their friends <i>carte blanche</i> invitations
to luncheon; but ladies as a rule seldom avail themselves
of this <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>, as they consider it, and prefer to
await a more direct form of invitation. Gentlemen, on the
contrary, are expected to avail themselves of this proffered
hospitality without ceremony, as the presence of a gentleman
visitor at luncheon is considered an acquisition, the
reason, perhaps, being that ladies are usually in the majority
at luncheon, and also that the unexpected arrival of one or
two ladies would call for a greater amount of attention on
the part of a hostess seated at luncheon than would the
unexpected arrival of gentlemen, ladies requiring especial
attention to be shown to them in the matter of a place at
table, etc., while gentlemen are ready to offer attention
instead of requiring it, and to take any place at table,
whether convenient or otherwise.</p>

<p>As a rule, the number of ladies present at luncheon
greatly exceeds the number of gentlemen present, unless at
a luncheon-party, when a hostess usually endeavours to
equalise the numbers as far as possible; but it is not imperative
for her to do this, and it is immaterial whether there
are as many gentlemen as ladies present at luncheon or not.</p>

<p>Luncheon is a very useful institution to a mistress of a
house, as it enables her to show a considerable amount of
civility to her friends and acquaintances.</p>

<p>She can invite to luncheon those it might not, for various
reasons, be convenient to invite to dinner; as for instance,
young ladies, single ladies, elderly ladies, ladies coming to
town, or into the neighbourhood for a few days only, and
so on.</p>

<p>The usual rule in houses where there are children old
enough to do so, is for the children to dine at luncheon
with their governess, whether there are guests present or
not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In Town the Usual Hour for Luncheon</big></b> is 1.30 to
2 o'clock; in the country it is generally half an hour earlier.
The guests are expected to arrive within ten minutes of the
hour named in the invitation, as although punctuality is not
imperative, it is very desirable.</p>

<p>A guest, on his or her arrival at a house, should not, if
previously invited, inquire if the mistress of the house is at
home, but should say, on the servant opening the door,
"Mrs. A. expects me to luncheon."</p>

<p>When the guests are self-invited, they should inquire if
the mistress of the house is at home.</p>

<p>Guests are conducted to the drawing-room before
luncheon. The servant precedes them, as at morning calls.</p>

<p>When guests arrive after the hour named for luncheon,
they should be at once ushered into the dining-room, and
their names announced.</p>

<p>When the guests are unacquainted with each other, the
hostess should make a sort of general introduction or introductions;
that is to say, she should introduce one gentleman
to two or three ladies, thus, "Mr. A., Mrs. B., Mrs. C.,
and Miss D.," making but one introduction in place of three
separate introductions, this being the less formal mode of
making unimportant introductions.</p>

<p>It is not always possible for a host to be present
at luncheon, owing to occupation and engagements, but
courtesy to his wife's guests demands his presence when
practicable. He should either join them in the drawing-room
or in the dining-room, according to his convenience.</p>

<p>Guests are not sent in to luncheon as they are to dinner.</p>

<p>Ladies should not remove their hats at luncheon. They
should remove their fur coats and wraps. These should
either be left in the hall on arrival or taken off in the
drawing-room or dining-room. Short gloves should be
removed; elbow gloves may be retained.</p>

<p>Gentlemen should not take their hats with them into the
drawing-room, but should leave them in the hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes is the usual time allowed between the
arrival of the guests and serving luncheon, which is usually
served at the hour named, the received rule being not to
wait for guests.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Going in to Luncheon.</big></b>&mdash;When the luncheon gong
sounds the hostess should say to the lady of highest rank
present, "Shall we go in to luncheon?" or some such
phrase. (See "The Art of Conversing.") The visitor should
then move towards the door. If the host is present, he
should walk beside her; if not, the hostess should do so.
The other ladies should follow as far as possible according
to precedency, the gentlemen going last. Thus the hostess
either follows with the ladies or leads the way.</p>

<p>Guests should not go in to luncheon arm-in-arm as at a
dinner-party, but singly, each lady by herself, or, when space
permits, side by side. Gentlemen likewise, but on arriving
in the dining-room, each gentleman should place himself
by the side of a lady, or between two ladies, at table.</p>

<p>The hostess should sit at the top of the table and the
host at the bottom, as at dinner, but it is immaterial where
the guests sit, although as a rule the lady of highest rank
sits by the host, and the gentleman of highest rank by the
hostess.</p>

<p>A late arrival should, on being ushered into the dining-room,
make his or her way to the top of the table to shake
hands with the hostess, making some polite excuse for
being late.</p>

<p>A hostess should rise from her seat to welcome a lady,
but she should not do so to welcome a gentleman.</p>

<p>Luncheon is either served <i>&agrave; la Russe</i> or not, according to
inclination, both ways being in equally good taste, although,
as a rule, the joint is served from the <i>buffet</i> or side-table,
while the <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, game, or poultry are placed on the table.</p>

<p>For further information respecting the arrangements for
luncheon, see the work entitled "Waiting at Table."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Formerly it was the custom in some houses for the
servants to leave the dining-room as soon as they had
helped the various guests to the joint or joints, and handed
round the vegetables and the wine, in which case the host
and hostess helped the guests to the <i>entr&eacute;es</i> and sweets,
or the gentlemen present did so; but now it is invariably
the rule for the servants to remain in the room during the
whole of luncheon, and to hand the dishes and wine, etc.,
to the guests as at dinner-parties.</p>

<p>Luncheon usually lasts about half an hour, during which
time the hostess should endeavour to render conversation
general.</p>

<p>As at dinner, it is the duty of a hostess to give the signal
for leaving the room, which she does by attracting the
attention of the lady of highest rank present by means of a
smile and a bow, rising at the same time from her seat.</p>

<p>The host, or the gentleman nearest the door, should
open it for the ladies to pass out.</p>

<p>The ladies should leave the dining-room as far as
possible in the order in which they have entered it, the
hostess following last.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When the host is not present</big></b>, the gentlemen should
follow the ladies to the drawing-room; but when the host
is present, the gentlemen should remain in the dining-room
with the host a short time before joining the ladies in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>It is optional on the part of the host whether he
returns or not with the gentlemen to the drawing-room,
although, if not particularly engaged, it is more courteous
to do so.</p>

<p>Coffee is sometimes served after luncheon in the
drawing-room. It is handed on a salver immediately after
luncheon. The most usual way now, however, is to have
coffee brought into the dining-room at the conclusion of
luncheon, and handed to the guests on a salver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The guests are not expected to remain longer than
twenty minutes after the adjournment to the drawing-room
has been made.</p>

<p>Ladies should put on their gloves on their return to the
drawing-room after luncheon.</p>

<p>Ladies having motor-cars should previously desire their
chauffeurs to return for them from three to a quarter-past
three o'clock, and the servant should inform each guest of
the arrival of her motor-car.</p>

<p>When a lady requires a cab, she should ask the hostess's
permission to have one called for her.</p>

<p>The subject of leave-taking is fully described in
<a href="#Page_32">Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>BREAKFASTS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Breakfast Parties</big></b> have in certain circles become a
feature, and invitations to breakfast are issued both by
card and by note.</p>

<p>In official circles breakfast parties are frequently given,
the morning hours up to one o'clock being the only disengaged
portion of the day, and thus the opportunity is
taken for offering and receiving hospitality, and of enjoying
the society of friends and acquaintances. The breakfast
hour varies from ten to eleven, according to circumstances,
and the meal somewhat resembles a luncheon, fish, <i>entr&eacute;es</i>,
game, and cold viands being given, with the addition of
tea, coffee, and liqueurs.</p>

<p>Punctuality on these occasions is almost imperative, as
breakfast cannot be prolonged beyond a given limit, and
therefore it is not considered necessary to wait the coming
of a late guest.</p>

<p>The guests go in to breakfast as to luncheon. When a
party consists of both ladies and gentlemen, the hostess
should lead the way with the lady of highest rank, followed
by the other ladies, the gentlemen following with the
host.</p>

<p>When a party consists of gentlemen only, the host should
lead the way with the gentleman of highest rank, and should
indicate to the principal of the gentlemen present the
places he wishes them to occupy at table; the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of the company should seat themselves according to
inclination.</p>

<p>The table should be laid as for luncheon, and decorated
with flowers and fruit. Tea and coffee should be served
from a side table by the servants in attendance.</p>

<p>All dishes should be handed as at luncheon.</p>

<p>For the details of "Breakfast-table Arrangements and
Serving Breakfast," see the work entitled "Waiting at
Table."</p>

<p>The guests usually leave as soon as breakfast is over,
unless the ladies are invited by the hostess to accompany
her to the drawing-room, or the gentlemen are invited by
the host to smoke a cigarette or cigar previous to their
departure.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>House Party Breakfasts.</big></b>&mdash;In the country the breakfast
hour varies from 9 to 10.30, and in some country houses
it is an understood thing that the guests are at liberty to
come down to breakfast at any time between nine and half-past
ten. In not a few country houses the hostess and the
ladies breakfast in their own rooms, and the gentlemen
of the party breakfast with the host in the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>The breakfast gong is a signal for assembling in the
breakfast-room or dining-room, but it is not the custom to
wait for any one beyond five or ten minutes.</p>

<p>The host and hostess at once take their places at the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>When the house-party is a large one, and space permits,
a number of small tables should be arranged in the breakfast-room,
in addition to a long breakfast-table.</p>

<p>The servants should remain in attendance during breakfast
to wait upon the guests.</p>

<p>There is no general move made from the breakfast-table
as in the case of luncheon or dinner; the hostess generally
remains until the whole of the guests have at least commenced
breakfast, save in the case of very late comers, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
whom she would not be expected to remain at the head of
the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>The guests leave the breakfast-table as soon as they have
finished breakfast, without waiting for any intimation from
the hostess to do so.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>PICNICS AND WATER-PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Many</span> things contribute to draw people into the country
and away from town in the month of September; therefore
there is a far larger number in each and every neighbourhood
inclined for a picnic or a water-party than in the
three previous months, June, July, and August.</p>

<p>Picnic parties are sometimes invitation parties, and on
other occasions contribution parties, or parties which
partake in a measure of the character of both.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Picnics by Motor-Car and Picnics by Rail.</big></b>&mdash;Almost
every county has its show place, or its ruins, its
ruined abbey or its castle, its romantic scenery, and its fine
views, its hills or its dales, its waterfalls or its glens. The
southern and western counties are as rich in these respects
as the eastern counties are barren.</p>

<p>When a picnic party is to proceed to its destination by
rail, a saloon carriage is engaged beforehand, and arrangement
is made at the nearest hotel to supply the party with
luncheon at from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> per head, according to the
style of luncheon required; or hampers of provisions are
taken under the charge of one or two men-servants.</p>

<p>If the picnic party proceeds by road, a coach is the
favourite mode of conveyance, whether driven by the owner
or hired for the occasion. This is a more sociable way of
going to a picnic than dividing the party into detachments
and conveying them in separate carriages. This is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
unavoidable, and if the party is assembled for a start, it
occasions no little discussion as to how the party should
be divided and conveyed in the various carriages, and it
takes no little tact to arrange this in a satisfactory manner&mdash;to
overrule objections, and to make things work smoothly.
Again, the members of a picnic party occasionally find their
way to the place of rendezvous independently of each other;
but, although this plan saves trouble, it does not promote
sociability, and parties of four or six are apt to clique
together during the day, instead of making themselves generally
agreeable. The provision question is a very important
one, and the heads of a picnic party should arrange in
concert what each is to bring in the way of fish, flesh, fowl,
fruit, and wine.</p>

<p>The services of one or two men-servants at a large
picnic party are generally required to arrange the table, to
open the wine, and last, but not least, to collect and repack
the articles used in the way of plate, china, or glass.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A picnic luncheon in September</big></b> is not always the
<i>al fresco</i> spread under the greenwood tree that it is in July,
and oftener than not is held in the best parlour of a rustic
inn, or, by permission, in a barn or shed, when the weather
is not favourable for camping out.</p>

<p>Usually, when a large picnic party is arranged and got
up by some three or four ladies and gentlemen, they divide
the expenses of the entertainment between themselves, and
determine how many shall be invited, each having the
privilege of inviting a certain number. Other picnics are
got up on a different system, each person contributing a
share towards the general expenses; but these gatherings
are not so sociable as are the invitation picnics.</p>

<p>Invitation picnics where everything is done <i>en prince</i>
are extremely enjoyable and friendly affairs; they are
big luncheons, given out-of-doors instead of indoors, at a
distance instead of at home. But even these are not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
pleasant than those well-arranged little picnics given by
officers in country quarters, when the regimental coach
conveys a favoured few to some favourite spot.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Water-Parties.</big></b>&mdash;There are many ways of arranging
a water-party at yachting stations and at all riverside places.
At yachting stations, for instance, a sailing yacht is hired
to convey a party of from eighteen to twenty-five to some
point of interest on the coast, in which case luncheon and
tea are provided at an hotel in the vicinity of the place
where the party have landed, and the expenses are equally
divided. Not unfrequently, on the return journey, the
yacht is becalmed, and does not reach its destination
until between two and three the following morning. If
it happens to be a fine moonlight night, this prolongation
of a water-party is an additional source of enjoyment;
but if there is no moon as well as no wind, and the
calm betokens a storm, it is the reverse of pleasant. But
these little <i>contretemps</i>, when they do occur, rather lend
a zest to the day's pleasure, and are something to talk
about afterwards.</p>

<p>Water-parties are often given by owners of yachts.
These are invitation parties, and luncheon, tea, and sometimes
dinner, are served on board, and the party land and
stroll about, but return to the yacht to be entertained.</p>

<p>Picnic and water-parties in general include as many
gentlemen as ladies, whether they are invitation or contribution
parties, although sometimes a majority of ladies is
unavoidable. Ryde is a favourite station for water-parties,
as the island itself, as well as the opposite coast, offer innumerable
points of interest for picnicing, and many are
able to combine the pleasures of the yacht with those of
the launch in one and the same water-party; thus a party
sails from Ryde to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, and then proceeds
in a steam, or other, launch to Alum Bay. Launch
parties are immensely popular, both on the river and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
coast. Some picnic on board, and others on shore, as they
feel disposed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Canoe-parties</big></b> on coast and river are also popular
with both ladies and gentlemen, and here again the useful
launch is brought into requisition to convey the party home,
as an hour and a half to two hours is an average time to
paddle a canoe; after that time the party land either on
the rocks or on the shore, and light a fire and boil the
kettle for tea. If the tea-drinking and the after-tea ramble
are unduly prolonged there is a chance, if on the coast,
of the steam-launch running out of coal, and of the party
having to return home in their own canoes considerably
later than was expected, and not a little fatigued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>JUVENILE PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Juvenile Parties</big></b> form a prominent feature in the
entertainments given during the winter months. There
is scarcely a household the children of which are not
indulged with one large party at least, while others are
allowed as many as two or three children's parties during
the winter months. These parties offer no little elasticity
as to their arrangement, varying from a child's tea party,
composed, perhaps, of five or six children, to a juvenile
ball, or fancy dress ball. Some mothers object, on principle,
to the latter entertainments, on the ground that to
give a large juvenile ball provokes a corresponding number
of invitations, and that a round of such gaieties is not good
for young children, either from a moral or from a hygienic
point of view. Morally, that such amusements are likely
to destroy or impair the freshness of childhood, and to
engender artificial ideas in their young minds in place of
such as are natural and healthy, and that the imitation of the
manners and bearing of their elders causes them to become
miniature men and women, and divests them of the attributes
of artless and unaffected childhood.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The dresses worn by children</big></b> at these entertainments
are of so elaborate a character&mdash;and so much pride is
exhibited when wearing them&mdash;that a spirit of vanity and a
love of dress are aroused at a prematurely early age. From
a physical point of view, late hours, heated rooms, rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dainties, and constant excitement have a pernicious effect
upon children.</p>

<p>There is, of course, an opposite view taken by those who
uphold juvenile balls; they consider that children are the
better for associating with others of their own age outside
of their own family circle, and that in the case of only
children such association is calculated to render them lively
and intelligent. Another argument in favour of these
juvenile parties is, that children who are in the habit of
constantly attending them acquire self-possessed and confident
manners, and that all shyness, <i>mauvaise honte</i> and
<i>gaucherie</i>, which distinguish many children when in the
company of strangers, are dispelled by frequent intercourse
with children of all ages. Thus, in place of the noisy game
of romps, the little gentlemen ask the little ladies to dance,
pull costume bon-bons with their favourite partners, and offer
them similar attentions throughout the evening. Of course,
there are shy little gentlemen and shy little ladies even at
a juvenile ball; but it is the constant endeavour of those
who accompany them, whether mammas, elder sisters, young
aunts, or grown-up cousins, to persuade them to get the
better of this diffidence, and to induce taciturn Master
Tommy to dance with timid Miss Tiny. Sometimes Master
Tommy is obstinate, as well as taciturn, and his "won't" is
as strong as his will. As with all things, so with children's
parties, the medium course is, perhaps, the wisest to take,
running into neither extreme&mdash;avoiding too much seclusion
or overmuch gaiety, and rendering such gaiety and amusement
suitable to the ages of the children invited. When an
evening's entertainment consists of a series of amusements,
it is a mistake to crowd too great a variety into the space of
four hours, the usual limits of a child's party, for if so the
programme has to be hurriedly gone through, and is hardly
finished before the hour of departure. No little judgment
is required when organising juvenile parties. The hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
usually selected for children's parties, whether on a large or
small scale, are from four to eight, five to nine, six to ten, or
from seven to eleven.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The children on their arrival</big></b> are received in the
drawing-room. In most cases their relatives, either mothers
or grown-up sisters, are asked to accompany them.</p>

<p>There is great punctuality observed as regards the hour
of arrival, and tea is usually served in the dining-room
about half an hour after that named on the invitation card.
The interim is generally passed by children in watching
each fresh arrival, and in greeting their little acquaintances,
comparing notes with each other as to the teas and the
parties they are going to, or in amusing themselves with
the toys belonging to the children of the house, which are
usually arranged on tables for this purpose; and mechanical
toys, walking and talking birds, etc., musical toys, picture-books,
and dolls, and the latest and newest inventions in
the way of playthings afford the little visitors an opportunity
for becoming at ease with each other.</p>

<p>Tea is generally dispensed at one end of a long table,
and coffee at the opposite end. The governess usually pours
out the tea, and one of the daughters of the house the coffee;
or failing her, the head nurse or lady's maid does so. Dishes
of pound, plum, and sponge cake are placed the length of
the table, interspersed with plates of thin bread-and-butter,
biscuits, and preserves; either the ladies of the family or
the servants in attendance hand them to the children.</p>

<p>When the relatives accompany the children tea is usually
served to them in another room, but frequently they do not
arrive until tea is over, and the nurses accompany the
children to the house.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Amusements.</big></b>&mdash;The arrangements for the evening's
amusement are regulated in a measure by the amount of
accommodation a house affords, premising that boisterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
games are not allowed in drawing-rooms, unless all valuable
ornaments or things likely to be broken are removed
from the rooms.</p>

<p>If conjuring is one of the amusements provided, it
generally takes place in the drawing-room immediately
after tea, and lasts about an hour. A dancing-cloth is put
down over the drawing-room carpet; rout seats or cane
chairs are arranged in rows. The youngest children are
seated in the first row. Performing birds, performing dogs,
or performing monkeys are also favourite amusements at
these parties, and rank next to conjuring in the estimation
of children. Punch and Judy or marionettes are popular
drawing-room amusements, and either occupies the space of
an hour.</p>

<p>When a cinematograph show is the entertainment
provided, it takes place in the dining-room or library, or
perhaps in the housekeeper's room, if large enough for
the purpose.</p>

<p>Dancing or games usually precede these amusements,
and lasts from half to three-quarters of an hour; little girls
dance with each other round and square dances, as little
girls are, as a rule, more partial to dancing than are little
boys, although they one and all, great and small, join with
glee in a country dance, or in the Temp&ecirc;te, or in "Sir
Roger de Coverley."</p>

<p>Not longer than an hour is devoted to dancing, and this
is usually followed by games.</p>

<p>Impromptu charades is a favourite pastime with children;
but to avoid the juvenile audience becoming weary and
impatient during the preparation of the charades it is as
well they should be amused with some quiet game, such as
"forfeits," "cross questions and crooked answers," "proverbs,"
etc. At Christmas and New Year's parties the
distribution of presents is a very important feature;
Christmas trees are now rather discarded in favour of
greater novelties. "Father Christmas," "Santa Claus,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
"The Fairy Godmother," "The Fairies' Well," or the
"Lucky Bag" and "The Magic Log," are some of the
many devices for the distribution of presents; these popular
characters are represented by grown-up persons, and provoke
much wonder and admiration amongst children. The
presents are usually given at the close of the evening.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Light Refreshments</big></b> are provided in the dining-room&mdash;lemonade,
wine and water, every description of cake,
sandwiches, crystallised fruits, French plums, figs, almonds
and raisins, oranges, etc. Bon-bons containing paper caps,
etc., which afford children much amusement, are usually
provided.</p>

<p>When a juvenile ball is given a supper is provided;
otherwise light refreshments are considered sufficient, and
are served twice during the evening. Sometimes the
children of the family, if old enough and clever enough,
act a little play&mdash;some nursery fairy tale, condensed into
one act, such as "Beauty and the Beast," "Cinderella,"
etc.&mdash;which lasts about an hour, and is followed by dancing.</p>

<p>When a juvenile fancy ball is given, one or two fancy
quadrilles are arranged beforehand, to be danced by the
children in costume.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>WRITTEN INVITATIONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Writing Letters of Invitation</big></b>, and answering letters
of invitation, often occupy far longer time in the composition
than the writers would care to confess. The difficulty does
not lie in an invitation itself or in accepting or refusing it,
but rather in the form in which either should be couched,
the words that should be chosen, and the expressions that
should be used; one person is afraid of being too <i>empress&eacute;</i>,
another of being too formal or too stiff; one is fearful of
saying too little, another of saying too much.</p>

<p>When invitations are issued on dinner cards or on "at
home" cards, the note of acceptance should be as brief as
is the printed card of invitation, and to the printed card
requesting the pleasure of Mrs. Blank's company at dinner,
the stereotyped answer is invariably Mrs. Blank has much
pleasure in accepting Mrs. Dash's kind invitation for
Saturday the 21st, or Mrs. Blank regrets that a previous
engagement will prevent her having the pleasure of accepting
Mrs. Dash's kind invitation for Saturday, the 21st.</p>

<p>As regards those invitations that refer to visits of some
days' duration, those accustomed to give this description of
entertainment, know exactly what to say and how to say
it. The conventional civilities or affectionate cordialities,
as the case may be, occur in their proper places; but one
point is made clear in either case, namely, the length of
the visit to be paid. There are people who are under the
impression that to specify the exact length of a visit is in
a degree inhospitable, and not sufficiently polite; and they,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
therefore, as a sort of compromise, use the ambiguous term
"a few days" in lieu of distinctly defining the limit of these
invitations. So far from vague invitations such as these
being an advantage to invited guests, they not seldom place
them at a disadvantage at more points than one. They
are uncertain on what day they are to take their departure.
They do not wish by leaving a day earlier to disarrange
any little plans that their hostess may have contemplated
for their amusement; neither do they wish to prolong their
visit a day later, lest by so doing they should break in upon
any engagements that she may have formed on her own
account independently of her visitors. It is also not a
little awkward for guests to tell their hostess that they
think of leaving on Thursday by 12.20 train. It might
have suited the hostess very much better that her visitors
should have left on the Wednesday, and in her own mind
she had perhaps intended that the visit should end on that
day; but, having left the invitation open, more or less, by
saying "a few days," there is nothing left for her but to
sacrifice her own arrangements to the convenience of her
guests, as without discourtesy she could hardly suggest to
them that they should leave a day earlier than the one they
had named, and the visitors remain unconscious of having
in any way trespassed upon the good nature of their
hostess.</p>

<p>"A few days" is also an unsatisfactory wording of an
invitation to visitors themselves; as a rule, it means three
or four days, but there is also an uncertainty as to whether
the fourth day should be taken or not. Those who interpret
"a few days" to mean three days, make their plans for
departure accordingly; failing this, they are compelled to
leave their plans open, and stay from three to five days,
according as chance and circumstances may dictate. A
lady would perhaps require a little addition to her wardrobe
in the matter of a five days' visit over that of a three days'
stay; but this is a trifling detail, although it helps to swell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the list of minor inconveniences which are the result of
vague invitations. There are, of course, exceptions to every
rule, and there are people who use this phrase of "Will you
come and see us for a few days?" in the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> sense
of the word, and to whom it is immaterial whether their
guests remain three days or six days; but such an elastic
invitation as this is usually given to a relative, or to a very
intimate friend, whose footing in the house is that of a
relation, and with whom the hostess does not stand on
ceremony, as far as her own engagements are concerned;
and people on these friendly terms can talk over their
departure with their hostess, and consult her about it without
the faintest embarrassment.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The most satisfactory invitation</big></b> is certainly the
one that mentions the day of arrival and the day of departure.
Thus, after the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the invitation has been stated,
the why and the wherefore of its being given follows the gist
of the letter: "We hope you will come to us on Wednesday
the 23rd, and remain until the 27th." It is, of course,
open to a hostess to ask her visitors to prolong their stay
beyond the date named if she sees reason for so doing; but
this is the exception rather than the rule in the case of short
visits, and guests take their departure as a matter of course
on the day named in the invitation. Hostess and guests
are perfectly at ease upon the subject, and guests do not
feel on delicate ground with their hostess, or fear to outstay
their welcome. When a visit has been paid it is polite, if
not imperative, to write to the hostess and express the
pleasure that has been derived from it. Oftener than not
some little matter arises which necessitates a note being
written apart from this; but whether or not, good feeling
and good taste would dictate that some such note should
be written, and, as it can always include little matters of
general interest in connection with the past visit, it need
neither be over ceremonious nor coldly polite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>To write a letter asking for an invitation</big></b>, or to
answer a letter asking for an invitation, is in either case
a difficult letter to write, as many have ere this discovered.
When a married lady asks for an invitation for a young relative
or friend staying with her, to some dance or "at home"
to which she herself is invited, the note is simple enough,
and the answer is generally a card of invitation or a written
permission to bring her. Again, in the case of asking for
invitations for gentlemen, if a lady is going to a ball, she
can without hesitation, ask for cards of invitation for one or
two gentlemen friends of her own, mentioning their names
in the note. In this case also the answer is generally in the
affirmative, as men are always acquisitions at a ball. The
awkwardness of the situation arises when a good-natured
person is solicited to obtain an invitation to a smart ball for
a lady and her daughters, or for the young ladies only, the
latter knowing some one who would chaperon them if they
could only get an invitation. If the lady who asks for the
invitation is a fashionable ball-giver, the probability is that
her request will be granted; but if the contrary, the reverse
will most likely be the case. Even when writing to an
intimate friend, there is always a delicacy in asking for an
invitation for a third person, and society appears to become,
year after year, still more exclusive on this point. Many
people are reluctant, or decline altogether, to put themselves
under an obligation of this nature, even for those
with whom they are most intimate; it may be that the
number of refusals good-natured people have received from
their friends when trying to render services of this description,
have made them chary of putting themselves forward
again in a similar manner: it is chilling to be told that
the list is over full, or that so many people have been
refused already, or that there is not a card to spare. But a
few years ago a ball was not considered a success unless
it was an over-crowded one; the popularity of the ball-giver
was shown by the guests scarcely being able to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
standing-room. Thus, invitations were given right and left
to the friends of those who asked for them.</p>

<p>But the fashion of to-day is to style a crowded ball-room
a "bear-garden," and to confine the invitations, with but
very few exceptions, to those who are strictly on the visiting
list of the ball-giver; and pretty girls may sigh in vain for
an invitation to a ball given even by a relative or acquaintance
of their own, if not on their visiting list. Still,
invitations are constantly asked for by people for their
friends, and sometimes they are given and sometimes they
are refused, as the case may be, but much depends upon
the position of the one who solicits the favour.</p>

<p>If the giver of an entertainment wishes to oblige the
petitioner, she will stretch a point to do so; if not, she will
write a polite note of excuse, giving one of the reasons
before mentioned. It is thoroughly understood people do
not ask for invitations for themselves, whatever they may
do for their friends, and that they would not do so unless
they were themselves invited. Living at a distance modifies,
however, this latter rule; and friends in the country often
ask for invitations for friends in town, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Dinner invitations</big></b> are, as a matter of course, never
asked for; but invitations to garden-parties, afternoon "at
homes," and afternoon teas, are frequently asked for and
readily given. Some are intimate enough at the house
where they visit to take a relative or friend with them to
these afternoon gatherings without observing the punctiliousness
of asking for an invitation; others, on less intimate
terms, do not venture upon doing so.</p>

<p>In all cases when an invitation is asked for, a hostess
should never neglect to send a reply, and should not take
for granted that her friends will naturally understand that
silence gives consent, for under the circumstances it is very
possible to interpret it to signify a refusal.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>REFUSING INVITATIONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Many</span> reasons exist for declining invitations other than the
plea of a prior engagement.</p>

<p>"Mrs. M. regrets ('much regrets,' or 'very much regrets')
that a previous engagement prevents her having the pleasure
of accepting Mrs. N.'s 'invitation,' or 'kind invitation.'"
When on more intimate terms, Mrs. M. should write in the
first person when declining an invitation. It is an open
question whether the nature of the engagement should be
stated or not. Even intimate friends often confine themselves
to the statement of the bare fact only that a prior
engagement exists; others, on the contrary, state the nature
of the engagement, and there is no doubt that this latter
course considerably softens a refusal and lessens the disappointment
experienced, and therefore, when practicable,
should always be followed.</p>

<p>When a prior engagement cannot be made the basis of a
refusal, then the refusal must rest on other lines; ill health,
a severe cold, etc., are valid excuses. Failing these, the
refusal should be as follows:&mdash;"Mrs. Z. regrets she is unable
to accept Mrs. X.'s kind invitation, etc."</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that it is desirable to break an
engagement, circumstances having changed the aspect of
things. The invitation, perhaps, was a verbal one, and a
refusal was not easy at the moment.</p>

<p>Again, impromptu invitations are sometimes refused,
having been too hastily accepted&mdash;the servant who brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the note waited for an answer, and on the impulse of the
moment an affirmative answer was given; the wife had not
time to consult her husband, and accepted for him as well
as for herself; or perhaps some potent domestic reason that
could not be explained induced a subsequent refusal.</p>

<p>The fashionable world accepts refusals as a matter of
course, and fills up the gaps with other invitations.</p>

<p>Refusals of dinner invitations from those for whom a
dinner-party was partly originated are always disappointing,
even to the most popular of dinner givers, in the same
way that the absence of the principal neighbour from
a county entertainment is felt to cast a shadow over the
proceedings of the day.</p>

<p>Although printed cards of acceptance and of refusal are
in general use, yet many cases arise which render written
refusals imperative.</p>

<p>As regards the refusal of invitations asked for, such
requests should not be made unless on very safe ground,
and with a certainty of meeting with acquiescence, yet
occasionally these requests are either unwelcome or inadmissible,
and refusals are consequently given; but, unless
worded with tact and good nature, they are often the
cause of strained relations between both friends and
acquaintances.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>WALKING, DRIVING, AND RIDING</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>The Usual Hours for Walking</big></b> in the Park are
from 9 until 10.30 a.m. The hours for afternoon walking
and sitting in the Park are from 4 to 7 p.m. during the
summer months.</p>

<p>The fashionable hours for walking in the Park on
Sunday are from 1 to 2 p.m., both in winter and summer;
and from 5 to 7 p.m. in the summer months.</p>

<p>Married ladies can, if they please, walk out unaccompanied
or unattended in places of public resort in town
or on the parades of fashionable watering-places; but
married ladies, especially if they are young, usually prefer
the society of another lady, not so much, perhaps, for
propriety as for companionship, as to walk alone, either
in town or at fashionable watering-places, renders a lady
more or less conspicuous, especially if she is attractive and
well dressed.</p>

<p>A young lady can now also walk by herself in the Park
for the purpose of joining her friends and acquaintances,
both in the morning and in the afternoon, but she should
not sit alone.</p>

<p>Again, young ladies may walk alone in the fashionable
streets, but they should not loiter when alone at shop-windows
as they pass, but walk at a quick pace from shop
to shop, or from street to street.</p>

<p>In the quiet neighbourhoods of towns, suburban towns,
and watering-places, young ladies walk unaccompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and unattended to visit their friends residing in the near
vicinity of their homes, or to attend classes, or for the
purpose of shopping, etc. Indeed, great independence is
generally accorded in this respect, the line being drawn
at evening hours&mdash;that is to say, at walking alone after
dusk.</p>

<p>At watering-places, and at all public promenades, it is
usual for gentlemen to join ladies with whom they are
acquainted, and to walk with them for a short time
when it is apparent that their company is desired, but not
otherwise.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, whether related or not, should
never walk arm-in-arm, unless the lady is an elderly one, or
an invalid, and requires this support.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Driving.</big></b>&mdash;From 3 to 6.30 are the received hours for
the afternoon drive during the summer, and from 2.30 to
4.30 during the winter.</p>

<p>The following rules as regards entering and leaving
a carriage apply to a motor-car or an electric brougham
as far as the construction, make, and size of the same
render it possible.</p>

<p>When driving in an open or close carriage or motor-car
it is quite immaterial whether the owner occupies the right-hand
or the left-hand seat. The seat she occupies depends
upon which side she enters, as the lady driving with her
should enter before her and should seat herself on the
furthest seat.</p>

<p>A visitor should always enter the motor-car or carriage
before the hostess.</p>

<p>When three ladies enter a motor-car or carriage the
young unmarried lady should take the back seat and the
two married ladies should occupy the front seat; this is
a matter of courtesy on the part of a young lady due to
married ladies and not strictly demanded by etiquette.</p>

<p>A husband should sit with his back to the horses, or by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the side of the chauffeur in the case of a motor-car, when
a lady is driving with his wife.</p>

<p>A gentleman should be the first to get out of a motor-car
or carriage, with a view to assisting the ladies to do so.</p>

<p>As a rule the hostess should leave the carriage or car
after her guest and not before her, unless it is more
convenient to do otherwise.</p>

<p>When a lady is merely calling for an acquaintance to
take her for a drive, she should not descend from her car
or carriage for the purpose of allowing her to enter it
before her.</p>

<p>In the afternoon young ladies may drive alone in the
public thoroughfares, unaccompanied by married ladies. It
is permissible for a young lady to drive alone in the Park
or in the streets. A married lady can, as a matter of
course, drive unaccompanied.</p>

<p>It would be unconventional were a lady to drive alone
with a gentleman in his motor-car, unless he were nearly
related to her, or unless she were engaged to be married to
him.</p>

<p>It is usual for the owner of a carriage to sit with her face
to the horses; when a married lady is driving with her she
should sit beside her. When young ladies are driving with
her in addition to the married lady they should sit with
their backs to the horses.</p>

<p>When a lady is driving with her husband, and a young
lady accompanies her, she should not offer the front seat
to the young lady, but should retain it herself, and even
should the offer be made, a young lady should not avail
herself of it.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Riding.</big></b>&mdash;As regards riding in town, the hours for
practice in the Row are from 8 to 10 a.m. in summer
and 9 to 11 a.m. in winter, for inexperienced riders and
beginners; young ladies ride with a riding-master or with a
riding-mistress, or with a relative, as the case may be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The hours for riding in the Park range from 9.30 to
10.30 a.m.</p>

<p>It is thoroughly understood that a lady may ride in
the Park alone&mdash;that is, unaccompanied or unattended&mdash;for
the purpose of joining her friends. It is argued, in
these days of woman's emancipation, that no possible harm
or annoyance can arise from the fact of a lady riding unattended,
beyond the always possible chance of an accident.</p>

<p>Although great latitude is now allowed to young ladies
with regard to riding alone, many parents still prefer that
their daughters should be attended by their grooms.</p>

<p>Two ladies frequently ride together, unaccompanied by
a gentleman and unattended by a groom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>BOWING</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">As</span> regards the recognition of friends or acquaintances, it is
the privilege of a lady to take the initiative, by being the
first to bow. A gentleman should not raise his hat to a
lady until she has accorded him this mark of recognition,
although the act of bowing is a simultaneous action on the
part of both lady and gentleman, as a lady would hardly
bestow a bow upon a gentleman not prepared to return it.</p>

<p>The bow between intimate acquaintances takes the
character, when given by a lady, of a familiar nod in place
of a stiff bow.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a gentleman returns the bow</big></b> of a lady he
should do so by distinctly taking his hat off and as quickly
replacing it, not merely raising it slightly, as formerly, and
if he is an intimate acquaintance or friend, he should act
in a similar manner.</p>

<p>In France and on the Continent generally, the rule of
bowing is reversed, and the gentleman is the first to bow to
the lady, instead of the lady to the gentleman.</p>

<p>Between ladies but slightly acquainted, the one of highest
rank should be the first to bow to the other; between
ladies of equal rank it is immaterial which of the two bows
first.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A lady should not bow</big></b> to persons only known to
her by sight, although she may frequently have seen them
in the company of her friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>A lady should bow to a gentleman, either a friend or
acquaintance, even when he is walking with either a lady
or gentleman, with whom she is unacquainted.</p>

<p>Gentlemen do not raise their hats in recognition of each
other, but simply nod, when not walking with ladies, save
when a vast difference exists in rank or age.</p>

<p>When a gentleman meets another&mdash;a friend of his&mdash;walking
with a lady or ladies, with whom he himself is
unacquainted, he should raise his hat and look straight
before him, not at the lady or ladies.</p>

<p>A lady should not bow to another who, being a stranger
to her, has addressed a few remarks to her at an afternoon
party, as the fact of meeting at the house of a mutual friend
does not constitute an acquaintanceship, and does not authorise
a future bowing acquaintance.</p>

<p>Ladies, as a rule, are not too ready to bow to those whom
they have merely conversed with in a casual way. In the
first place, they are not quite certain of being remembered,
and nothing is more disconcerting and disagreeable than to
bow to a person who does not return it through forgetfulness
of the one who has given it, or through shortsightedness,
or through actual intention. Short-sighted people are
always offending in the matter of not bowing, and almost
every third person, comparatively speaking, complains of
being more or less short-sighted; thus it behoves ladies to
discover for themselves the strength and length of sight
possessed by their new acquaintances, or the chances are
that their bow may never be returned, or they may continue
to labour under the impression that they have received a
cut direct; thus many pleasant acquaintances are lost
through this misapprehension, and many erroneous impressions
created.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A bowing acquaintance</big></b> is a difficult and tiresome
one to maintain for any length of time, when opportunities
do not arise for increasing it. The irksomeness of keeping it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
up is principally experienced by persons meeting day after
day in the Park or on public promenades, riding, driving, or
walking, more especially when it is tacitly understood that
the acquaintance should not develop into a further
acquaintance.</p>

<p>It would be considered discourteous to discontinue a
bowing acquaintance which has once been commenced.</p>

<p>To know a gentleman by sight through having frequently
seen him at balls and parties, does not give a lady the right
to bow to him, even though she may have stood beside him
for some twenty minutes or so on a crowded staircase, and
may have received some slight civility from him.</p>

<p>A lady who has received a little service from a stranger
would gladly acknowledge it at any subsequent meeting by
a pleasant bow, but as bowing to a gentleman argues an
acquaintance with him, and as in such cases as these an
acquaintance does not exist, etiquette provides no compromise
in the matter. Therefore, if a young lady takes her
own line, and rather than appear ungracious bows to a
gentleman who has not been introduced to her either directly
or indirectly, it is a breach of etiquette on her part; and as
to do an unconventional thing is not desirable, the innumerable
little services which ladies receive in general society
are not further acknowledged beyond the thanks expressed
at the moment of their being received.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Bows vary materially</big></b>: there is the friendly bow, the
distant bow, the ceremonious bow, the deferential bow, the
familiar bow, the reluctant bow, and so on, according to
the feelings that actuate individuals in their intercourse with
each other.</p>

<p>When a bowing acquaintance only exists between ladies
and gentlemen, and they meet perhaps two or three times
during the day, and are not sufficiently intimate to speak,
they do not usually bow more than once, when thus meeting
in park or promenade.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>THE COCKADE</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Cockades are worn</big></b> by servants in livery of officers
in the army and navy, and all those who hold His
Majesty's commission; also of lords-lieutenants and deputy-lieutenants.</p>

<p>Retainers of the Crown are entitled to the use of the
cockade as a badge of the reigning dynasty.</p>

<p>The fact that cockades are now so frequently worn by
men-servants may be accounted for thus:</p>

<p>Deputy-lieutenants are far more numerous now than
was formerly the case; almost every country gentleman is a
deputy-lieutenant, and consequently his servants are entitled
to the use of the cockade. The privilege of appearing in
uniform at lev&eacute;es instead of in Court dress has been and
is an incentive to many to seek for and obtain the appointment
of deputy-lieutenant. Again, all justices of the peace
claim the use of the cockade as being "Civil retainers of
the Crown"; and although there is no clearly defined rule
on this head, according to the late Sir Albert Woods,
Garter-King-at-Arms, it has long been tacitly conceded to
them.</p>

<p>The custom of livery servants wearing cockades dates
from the commencement of the eighteenth century, and was
at first purely a military distinction.</p>

<p>The cockade worn by the servants of the members of
the Royal Family, and by all who claim to be of Royal
descent, is slightly different in shape from that known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the badge of the reigning dynasty, <i>i.e.</i> the Hanoverian
badge, and is round in shape and without a fan. The
military cockade is of an oval shape, terminating in a fan.
The civil cockade is of an oval shape also, but without the
fan. The naval cockade is identical with the civil cockade.</p>

<p>The white cockade is the badge of the House of Stuart.
The black cockade that of the House of Hanover. The
servants of foreign ambassadors wear cockades in colour
according to their nationalities. Black and white for
Germany; black and yellow for Austria; the tricolour
for France; scarlet for Spain; blue and white for Portugal;
and black and yellow for Belgium.</p>

<p>The word cockade, according to a well-known authority,
was borrowed from the French <i>cocarde</i>, having originally
been applied to the plumes of cock's feathers worn by
Croatian soldiers serving in the French army. Some such
plume, or in its place a bunch of ribbons, came to be used
in pinning up the flaps of the hat into a cocked position,
and thus gradually the word passed for the name of the
"cocked" hat itself.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3>COUNTRY-HOUSE VISITS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">September</span> is actually the commencement of the country
visiting season, the few visits that are paid in August are
but a prelude to the programme that is to follow during the
succeeding five months.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The visitors received in August</big></b> are principally
relatives. The exceptions to the August family parties are
the August cricket parties in the counties where cricket is
made a great feature during that month, where the cricket
weeks and consequent large country-house parties are of
annual recurrence, and where balls and private theatricals
form part of the week's amusement. It often follows that
people visit at the same houses year after year, they arrange
their tour of visits with regard to those invitations which
they annually receive; new acquaintances and new houses
whereat to visit are added to the list from time to time and
take the place of those which, as a matter of course, drop
out of it. Sometimes the invitations fit into each other
admirably, like the pieces of a puzzle; at others there is an
awkward interval of a day, or two or three days, to be filled
up between leaving one house and arriving at another. If
the hostess is, in either case, a relation or an intimate
friend, this difficulty is easily surmounted by staying on at
one house until the day fixed for arrival at another, or <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>; but if a guest is on ceremony with her hostess, or if,
as is often the case, new arrivals are expected for the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
week, the alternative is to spend a few days in town, as
although the house where the next visit to be paid might
be within twenty or thirty miles of the house the visitor is
about to leave, it would be unusual to spend the interval at
an hotel in the adjacent town, as to do so might reflect
upon the hospitality of the hostess. On the other hand,
invitations are sometimes given independently of dates, but
this friendly style of invitation is not given when a large
party is invited, and it is understood to mean that the
hostess may be quite alone, or may have guests staying
with her, as the case may be. This form of invitation is
frequently given to people visiting in Scotland, on account
of the great distance from town.</p>

<p>It is a very general custom to give shooting parties the
third week in September, harvest permitting. If the harvest
is late on account of unfavourable weather the shooting
parties are postponed until the first week in the ensuing
month. The guests, or at least the crack guns, are usually
invited for partridge driving, which is what partridge shooting
now actually amounts to.</p>

<p>There are large shooting parties and small shooting
parties, shooting parties to which royalty is invited and
shooting parties restricted to intimate friends or relations,
but in either case the period is the same, three days'
shooting.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>If a party is limited to five guns</big></b>, seven ladies is the
average number invited, the hostess relying upon a neighbour
or a neighbour's son to equalise the balance at the
dinner-table. The success of house-parties mainly depends
upon people knowing each other, or fraternising when they
are introduced or have made each other's acquaintance.
The ladies of a country-house party are expected, as a rule,
to amuse themselves, more or less, during the day. After
luncheon there is usually a drive to a neighbouring town, a
little shopping to be done there, or a call to be paid in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
neighbourhood by some of the party, notably the married
ladies, the young ladies being left to their own resources.</p>

<p>At the close of a visit game is offered to those of
the shooters to whom it is known that it will be
acceptable.</p>

<p>The head gamekeeper is usually instructed to put up a
couple of brace of pheasants and a hare. But in some
houses even this custom is not followed, and the whole of
the game killed, with the exception of what is required for
the house, finds its way into the market, both the local
market and the London market.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shooting parties as a rule give a hostess little anxiety
on the score of finding amusement for the ladies of
the party, as so many aids out of doors are at her command
at this season of the year. This is a great advantage,
as although some few ladies possessing great strength
of nerve have taken up shooting as an amusement and
pastime and acquit themselves surprisingly well in this
manly sport, yet ladies in general are not inclined for so
dangerous a game, and even those intrepid ladies who have
learnt how to use their little gun would never be permitted
to make one or two of a big shooting party, even were they
so inclined.</p>

<p>The hostess and the ladies of the party invariably join
the shooters at luncheon, and some of the ladies go out
with the shooters in the morning to watch their prowess in
the field; but this entails a great deal of walking where
partridge shooting is concerned, which is quite another thing
to covert shooting in November and December.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A good hostess has great opportunities</big></b> for distinguishing
herself when entertaining a country-house party,
from the arrival of the first motor-car to the departure of the
last. Her consideration and tact are so successfully exerted
that somehow her guests always find themselves doing exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
what they like best and in company with those who are
most congenial to them, to say nothing of the comfort of
the general domestic arrangements, which seem to have
been arranged exclusively for their convenience. If they
wish to drive, there is a carriage or motor-car at their disposal;
if they prefer a constitutional, there is some one very
agreeable desirous of walking with them. The daily papers
are always to be found, the post-bag goes out at a most
convenient hour by the hand of a special messenger, the
dinner is of the best, and the evening is of the cheeriest.
Bridge as a rule is played in most houses, and several tables
are arranged in the drawing-room to accommodate the
would-be players.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when the birds are wild and sport is slack,
a sort of picnic luncheon is held in the vicinity of a keeper's
lodge, under the shade of some wide-spreading trees, when
the ladies join the party; but in September keen sportsmen
rather despise this playing at shooting, and resent the interruption
caused by the company of ladies at luncheon, and
prefer to take it in the rough and smoke the while. Every
day of the week is not thus given up to shooting, and there
are few owners of manors who would care to provide five
days' consecutive sport for their guests, and two days' hard
shooting is probably followed by what is called an idle day.
On these off days in September the hostess often gives a
garden-party, or takes her guests to one given by a neighbour
at some few miles distant; or she holds a stall at a
bazaar and persuades her guests to assist her in disposing of
her stock; or she induces her party to accompany her to
some flower-show in which she takes a local interest; or the
host and one or two of the best shots start early after breakfast
to shoot with a neighbour, and the remainder of the
guests drive over to a picturesque ruin, where they picnic,
and return home in time for the eight-o'clock dinner. If the
owner of a mansion has a coach the whole party is conveyed
on it, otherwise the motor-cars are brought into requisition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
while saddle horses are provided for those who care to
ride. A country-house party occasionally resolves itself
into two or more cliques, as far as the ladies are concerned;
gentlemen, as a rule, are not much given to this sort of
thing. On the first evening, as soon as the ladies have left
the dining-room for the drawing-room, these little cliques
are tacitly formed, and continue unbroken until the close
of the visit. There are many reasons which call these cliques
into existence&mdash;old intimacies revived, new acquaintanceships
to be strengthened, unwelcome acquaintanceships
to be avoided, and so on. These cliques are by no means
agreeable to the hostess, indeed, quite the contrary&mdash;but
she is powerless to prevent their being formed, and she is
herself sometimes drawn into one or other of them, and
sometimes altogether excluded from them. Any one who is
at all conversant with country-house visiting is aware how
thoroughly the influence of the clique pervades the atmosphere
of the drawing-room; and yet, perhaps, at country-house
parties more friendships are formed and intimacies
cemented than at any other gatherings.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The evening amusements</big></b> at country-house parties
vary very much according to the proclivities of the hostess
or those of her daughters. At some houses dancing is the
order of things for a couple of hours or so after dinner, but
this mode of spending the evening does not always commend
itself to the gentlemen, who, after a long day's walking
through wet turnips and over heavy ploughed land, or a
hard day's riding over stiff fences, rather incline towards
the <i>dolce far niente</i> of a luxurious armchair than to the
pleasures of the mazy valse, and are proportionately grateful
to a hostess who does not call upon them to undergo any
further exercise than what they have already gone through
for their own pleasure.</p>

<p>In most country-house parties bridge forms the chief if
not the only amusement, and is played not only after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
dinner but in the afternoon also. Amateur theatricals and
<i>tableaux vivants</i>, impromptu charades, thought reading,
conjuring, etc., are fashionable amusements and easy of
accomplishment: the first-named of these demands considerable
study and plenty of time for rehearsal, therefore
theatricals are generally engaged in when the party is
composed of relatives rather than of acquaintances, and
when the visit would be perhaps prolonged to ten days or a
fortnight.</p>

<p>Some hostesses prefer keeping late hours to early hours,
and do not retire until after twelve; this does not commend
itself to the gentlemen, as they are not supposed to adjourn
to the smoking-room until the ladies have left the drawing-room,
and gentlemen like to spend a couple of hours in the
smoking-room after dinner.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In hunting counties</big></b> the breakfast is usually an early
one, varying from nine o'clock to half-past nine, according to
whether the ride to covert is likely to be a long or a short
one; but, as a rule, the nominal breakfast hour is 9.30
o'clock. A certain amount of latitude is allowed to guests
as regards coming down to breakfast; they do not assemble
in the morning-room, but all make their way to the breakfast-room,
and seat themselves at once at table, while many
ladies breakfast in their own rooms.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In Scotland, an invitation to shoot</big></b> often means a
visit of three weeks. The accommodation of the shooting-box
or lodge may be limited or primitive, and it is very often
both of these; but it matters very little to the sportsman
what sort of bed he sleeps on, or how he is made to rough
it, providing the grouse are plentiful. On some of the moors
there are but cottages and farmhouses for the occupation of
the sportsmen, but on others the houses are excellent, and
let with the moors, as many take a moor season after season
and invite their friends to shoot between the 12th of August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and October. The grand shooting parties that are annually
given in Scotland by owners of large estates and fine shootings
extends throughout the whole of the shooting season,
and guests come and go without intermission; as one leaves
another arrives. Certain houses or castles are much gayer
than others; to some very few ladies are asked, the majority
of the guests being gentlemen&mdash;probably the hostess and
two ladies and eight men&mdash;in others, the numbers are more
equal; in others, again, the party sometimes consists entirely
of men with a host and no hostess. Ladies generally ask
their most intimate friends to Scotland rather than acquaintances,
as they are left to themselves the whole of the day,
dinner being often postponed until nine o'clock, on account
of the late return of the sportsmen.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>South of the Tweed, September invitations</big></b> are
usually given for three or four days, from Tuesday till Saturday;
married couples, young ladies, and young men, are all
asked, and the ladies find amusement in lawn-tennis, or in
attending or assisting at some neighbouring bazaar or fancy
fair, as in this month county bazaars are very popular, and
the visitors at one house lend their services in conjunction
with the visitors at another, to hold stalls at a bazaar got
up by a third influential lady; and thus the stalls are
well stocked, and the fashionable stall-holders give an
impetus to the whole affair.</p>

<p>Ladies see very little of the gentlemen between breakfast
and dinner. The shooters start about eleven, and seldom
return much before seven.</p>

<p>When it is dark at four, those who prefer ladies' society
and tea to the smoking-room and billiards, make themselves
presentable and join the ladies.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As regards the Etiquette of Visiting at
Bachelors' Houses.</big></b>&mdash;It is thoroughly understood that
ladies should be accompanied by their husbands, and young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ladies by their father and mother, or by a married couple
with whom they are on terms of great intimacy, in which
case the married lady acts as chaperon to the young ladies.
Young ladies cannot stay at the house of a bachelor
unless chaperoned by a married lady, or by a female
relative of their host. A widow and her daughter could
of course join a party of ladies staying at a bachelor's
house, or stay on a visit to him were he alone, or entertaining
bachelor friends.</p>

<p>When a bachelor gives a country-house party, and
nominally does the honours himself, occasionally one of
the married ladies of the party tacitly takes the lead.</p>

<p>The position of a young widower is similar to that of a
bachelor as regards society. Later in life, the contrary is
the case; a widower with grown-up daughters gives entertainments
for them, and the eldest daughter does the
honours, thus reducing the position again to that of host
and hostess.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3>HUNTING AND SHOOTING</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Ladies in the Hunting-Field.</big></b>&mdash;There is no arena
better fitted to display good riding on the part of women
than the hunting-field, and no better opportunity for the
practice of this delightful accomplishment and for its
thorough enjoyment. It is urged, however, that it argues
cruelty of disposition and unwomanly feeling to join in the
pursuit of a poor, miserable, hunted fox, and worse still to
be in at the death, and that women are liable to be carried
away by the enthusiasm of the hour to applaud and to
witness what they would otherwise shrink from. This
argument has a certain weight, and deters many from
actually hunting who would otherwise join in the sport,
and they make a compromise by regularly attending the
meets, and even witnessing a throw-off of a fox-break
covert. Every strong point that a rider possesses is brought
out in the field. The canter in the Row, the trot through
the country-lanes, or the long country ride are very feeble
substitutes for the intense enjoyment experienced when
taking part in a good run; the excitement felt and shared
in by the whole field exhilarates and stimulates, and renders
fatigue a thing out of the question, not to be thought of
until the homeward ride is well over.</p>

<p>Considering the number of ladies who hunt, the accidents
that occur are surprisingly few, for the obvious reason
that ladies do not attempt to hunt unless their skill as
good horsewomen is beyond all question. Their husbands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
their fathers, their brothers would not allow them to
jeopardise their lives, unless their riding and experience,
their courage, their nerve, and their instruction justified
the attempt.</p>

<p>There are also two other weighty considerations necessary
to success&mdash;a good mount, and a good lead. The
father or husband invariably selects the one, and the friend&mdash;either
of the fair rider or of the husband or brother&mdash;gives
the all-important lead, without which few ladies
venture upon hunting, save those few who are independent
enough to cut out their own work.</p>

<p>Ladies, who are naturally fond of riding, cannot always
indulge in the pleasure of hunting, on the ground of expense,
for instance. A lady may possess a fairly good
horse for ordinary purposes, to ride in the Row, or for
country exercise, but very few gentlemen of moderate
means can afford to keep hunters for the ladies of their
families as well as for themselves, although, in fiction, this
is freely done. If a lady has one good hunter of her own,
she may expect two days' hunting a week, providing the
country is not too stiff, and the meets are fairly convenient.
Occasionally, a mount may be obtained from a good-natured
friend, whose stud is larger than his requirements;
but this is not to be depended upon in every-day life, and
popular ladies and first-rate riders are more in the way of
receiving these attentions than the general run of ladies.</p>

<p>As regards the presence of young ladies in the hunting-field,
there are two opinions respecting its advisability,
apart from the question of whether it is or is not a feminine
pursuit. The long ride home in the November and
December twilight, in the company of some member of
the hunt, who has become the young lady's cavalier for
the time being, is not to the taste of many parents; chaperonage
must of necessity be greatly dispensed with in the
hunting-field, and this is an objection which many fathers
advance against their daughters hunting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Some husbands entertain equally strict views on this
head, and are of opinion that the boldest rider and the best
lead to follow in the field is not always the guest they would
most desire to see at their own firesides.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Hunt-Breakfasts.</big></b>&mdash;A lady should not go to a hunt-breakfast
at the house of a country gentleman if unacquainted
with him, or some member of his family, unless
asked to do so by a mutual acquaintance. All gentlemen
riding to hounds, whether strangers to the host or not, have
the privilege of entering any house where a hunt-breakfast
is given and accepting the hospitality offered. The breakfast,
which is in reality a cold collation, with the addition
of wine, liqueurs, ale, etc., is usually laid out in the dining-room,
and no ceremony whatever is observed; the gentlemen
come and go as they please.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house should either be present at a
hunt-breakfast and receive the ladies who arrive in the hall
or dining-room, or she should receive them in the drawing-room,
where refreshments should be brought to them.</p>

<p>When a hostess intends riding to hounds, she is often
mounted before her neighbours arrive, in which case she
invites them to enter the house for refreshments, if they
care to do so.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Gentlemen who go down into a County</big></b> for a few
days' hunting only seldom wear "pink," and prefer riding
to hounds in black coats.</p>

<p>The members of the hunt wear pink as a matter of
course, but it is considered better taste for a stranger to
wear a black coat than to appear in a <i>new</i>, <i>very new</i>,
unspecked red one.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Sporting Terms.</big></b>&mdash;Persons unversed in matters appertaining
to "country life" and "country sports," town bred,
and who have had little or no opportunity of acquiring a
knowledge of the subject from personal experience, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
hardly fail to commit many and various mistakes when
brought into contact with sportsmen and their sports.</p>

<p>A knowledge of sporting matters and sporting terms,
and the etiquette observed by sportsmen, is only arrived at
by associating with those thoroughly conversant with the
subject, and with whom "sport" has formed part of their
education so to speak.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Shooting Season commences</big></b> on the 12th of
August with grouse shooting in the north of England,
Scotland, and Ireland. Partridge shooting commences on
the 1st of September and terminates on the 1st of February.</p>

<p>The finest partridge shooting is allowed by general
consent to be found in the eastern counties.</p>

<p>Partridge driving does not take place until January to
any great extent.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Pheasant Shooting</big></b> commences the 1st of October
and terminates the 1st of February.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Hares</big></b> may be shot up to the 1st of March.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Rabbits</big></b> may be shot all the year round.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Rooks</big></b> are shot during the spring and summer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is difficult to make a would-be sportsman comprehend
the strict etiquette maintained between the owners of
manors; that is to say, he would think nothing of crossing
the boundary of his host's manor, "gun in hand," if he felt
inclined to follow a bird or hare he had wounded, oblivious
of the fact that, in the first place, the greatest punctiliousness
is observed between gentlemen in the matter of trespassing
on each other's land when out shooting; and, that unless
the greatest intimacy existed, a sportsman would hardly
venture to pick up his dead bird if it had fallen on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
neighbour's manor, and would on no account look for a
wounded bird, but for a dead one only. In the second
place he would carefully observe the rule of leaving his gun
on his own side of the boundary, and would certainly not
carry it with him to his neighbour's land. These are points
that strangers invited for a few days' shooting very often
fall foul of, creating thereby much unpleasantness for their
host through their ignorance and inexperience.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a gentleman is invited to join</big></b> a shooting-party,
it would not be necessary for him to take a loader with
him, as his host would find a man to perform that office for
him, unless he had a servant with him capable of performing
that duty; but if he were residing in the neighbourhood he
would, as a matter of course, take his loader with him when
asked to join a shooting-party, and in both cases he would
shoot with two guns, as to shoot with one gun only causes
a vexatious delay.</p>

<p>A frequent cause of offence to sportsmen is for a
gentleman to be noisy when out shooting, that is to
say, to be "loudly talkative," or "boisterously merry,"
or given to indulge in exclamations when a bird rises, or
when a bird is missed; your true sportsman maintains a
strict silence.</p>

<p>There are numberless other points relating to field sports
wherein the "inexperienced sportsman" is apt to give
offence, but which would take up too much space to enter
into in a work of this description.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Fees, or Tips to the Gamekeepers</big></b>, vary from
10<i>s.</i> to &pound;5, according to the number of days' shooting
enjoyed or the extent of the bag.</p>

<p>For one day's partridge-shooting the tip to the head
gamekeeper would be a sovereign; for a good day's
pheasant-shooting, as much as two sovereigns would probably
be given. A gentleman who does not tip or fee up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to this mark is not likely to find himself too well placed in
a battue.</p>

<p>The cost of a game licence is &pound;3, and lasts twelve
months, from 1st August to the 31st of July the following
year, or &pound;2 from the 1st of August to the 31st of October,
or &pound;2 from the 1st of November to the 31st of July in the
following year, or &pound;1 for fourteen days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3>SHAKING HANDS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> etiquette with regard to shaking hands is not an
open question, it is distinct enough and simple enough for
all exigencies, but yet there is individual temperament to be
taken into account which in many drives etiquette out of
the field, if by etiquette is understood not merely stiff propriety
of action, but politeness in the truest sense of the
word, and doing that which is exactly the right thing to do.
Etiquette rules when to shake hands and when not to do
so, when to bow and when not to bow; but in spite of this
knowledge, which is within every one's reach, there are
many mistakes made on this head.</p>

<p>For instance, one does not offer to shake hands when
expected to do so; another offers to shake hands three
times; one displays unwarrantable warmth in shaking
hands; another extends two fingers only; one shakes hands
in a limp and uncomfortable manner, and takes the extended
hand merely to drop it; another literally pumps the extended
hand, or crushes the rings into a lady's fingers when
shaking hands with her.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A lady who does not shake hands</big></b> when expected
to do so is actuated by one or other of the following reasons&mdash;she
did not wish to shake hands with a certain acquaintance,
and preferred to bow only, or she was not aware
whether she should have shaken hands or not.</p>

<p>The gentlemen who shake hands with great warmth and
<i>empressement</i> are two distinct individuals; the one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
cordial and large-hearted, and has a friendly grasp for
every one&mdash;a grasp indicative of kindliness, geniality, and
good fellowship&mdash;the other wishes to ingratiate himself in
certain quarters, and loses no opportunity of demonstratively
shaking hands, but no one is deceived by this spurious
imitation of the real thing.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When a lady gives but two fingers</big></b> to people
whom she does not care about, she is always a person who
fancies herself, and who feels very fine; she doubtless is, but
her good breeding and her good feeling are both in question
when she takes this method of showing the superiority of
herself and her position over that of other people.</p>

<p>There are other eccentricities indulged in by different
people who shake hands when they should not, and people
who do not shake hands when they should.</p>

<p>It depends upon whom a lady is introduced to, or upon
who is introduced to her, whether she should or should not
shake hands. She should not shake hands on being casually
introduced to a person altogether a stranger to her; but
yet there are so many occasions when it is both proper and
correct to shake hands on being introduced, that the rule
on this head is a very elastic one.</p>

<p>For instance, a host and hostess should shake hands with
every stranger introduced to them at their house.</p>

<p>A lady should shake hands on being introduced to the
relations of her intended husband.</p>

<p>A lady should shake hands on being introduced to the
friend of an intimate friend.</p>

<p>When a lady has entered into conversation to any extent
with some one to whom she has been introduced, and finds
she has much in common with her, she should shake hands
on taking leave; but if she has only exchanged a few commonplace
sentences, a bow would be all that is necessary.</p>

<p>A lady usually takes the initiative with regard to shaking
hands as with bowing; but in reality it is a spontaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
movement, made by both lady and gentleman at the same
moment, as the hand ought not to be extended or the bow
given unless expected and instantaneously reciprocated.</p>

<p>A young lady should not offer to shake hands with one
not expectant of the honour.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Shaking hands on taking leave is</big></b>, with some few
people, a graceful and pleasant fashion of saying good-bye;
intimate friends hold the hand while the last words are being
said. Women hold each other's hands thus on parting, and
some few men take each other's hands; but with them it is
rather a foreign fashion, and is principally followed by those
who have lived much on the Continent; for, as a rule, an
Englishman prefers the hearty English shake of the hand.</p>

<p>A lady having once shaken hands with another, should
continue to do so at subsequent meetings, unless a coolness
of manner warns her that a bow would be more acceptable.</p>

<p>With regard to shaking hands at a dinner-party with
acquaintances: if the dinner-party is a small one, and there
is time to shake hands, it is correct to do so; but when
there is little time before dinner, and no good opportunity
for shaking hands, bows to acquaintances at distant parts of
the room, or when seated at the dinner-table, are sufficient
recognition for the time being.</p>

<p>At an evening-party it depends upon opportunity whether
acquaintances shake hands or not.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The fashion of raising the arm</big></b> when shaking hands
is followed by very few in the exaggerated style in which it
was first introduced, but a modification of it has distinctly
become the fashion in general society.</p>

<p>The hand, instead of being extended straight out, is now
offered on a line or parallel with the chest, a trifle higher
than the old-fashioned style, and the fingers of the hand
are held and gently shaken, but the palm is not grasped or
even touched.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<h3>CHAPERONS AND D&Eacute;BUTANTES</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">An</span> unmarried lady, unless she be a maiden-lady of a
recognised age and standing, cannot act as an orthodox
chaperon; but, on the other hand, a young married lady
could do so with the greatest propriety, as could a brother
from the age of eighteen; of other relatives it is not necessary
to speak.</p>

<p>Young ladies are now frequently asked to dinner-parties
without a chaperon, a hostess constituting herself chaperon
for the occasion. Dances are also given to which it is
understood chaperons are <i>not</i> invited, the hostess again
acting in that capacity, but at large balls and dances
chaperonage is considered indispensable for young ladies.
At theatres and evening concerts chaperonage is distinctly
required; but at morning concerts and <i>matin&eacute;es</i>, companionship
rather than chaperonage is needed.</p>

<p>As regards morning hours. Young ladies may now walk
together in the Park and elsewhere; ride together, attend
classes together or alone, go to luncheon or afternoon tea
alone or together at the houses of friends and acquaintances,
quite unaccompanied by a chaperon. They may also visit
at country houses without a chaperon, the hostess performing
this duty.</p>

<p>At all out-door gatherings, such as garden-parties, tennis-parties,
cricket-matches, golf-meetings, etc., the chaperonage
required is of the slightest, and for which any might be
made available.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<h3>PRESENTATIONS AT THE VICEREGAL COURT, DUBLIN
CASTLE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> Drawing-rooms at Dublin Castle are held by the Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland and his wife, in St. Patrick's Hall,
at 10.15 o'clock p.m.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady who desires</big></b> a presentation at the Viceregal
Court must be presented by a lady who has herself
been presented thereat, and it is necessary that she herself
should be present on the occasion, save under exceptional
circumstances. A lady is not allowed to present more than
<i>two</i> ladies, except in special cases to be sanctioned by His
Excellency.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady who proposes being presented</big></b> at a Viceregal
Drawing-room must send to the Chamberlain's office
by five o'clock, three days previous to the Drawing-room,
a card with her name and address both in town and country,
and the name and address of the lady by whom she is to
be presented distinctly written thereon, and stating which
Drawing-room she wishes to attend, to be submitted to
the Lord-Lieutenant and his wife for their Excellencies'
approval. Also two Presentation Cards must be obtained
at the Chamberlain's office two days before the Drawing-room&mdash;if
they have not previously been sent by post&mdash;and
must be filled in with the necessary particulars, and taken
to the Castle on the evening of the Drawing-room, one to be
delivered to the official stationed in the Corridor, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
other to be handed to the Chamberlain, who will announce
the name. It is requested that the names may be very
distinctly written upon the cards, that there may be no
difficulty in announcing them.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Lady attending</big></b> a Viceregal Drawing-room, who
has been already presented at the Viceregal Court, must
leave at the Chamberlain's office, three days previous to the
Drawing-room, a card with her name and address, both in
town and country, distinctly written thereon, and stating
which Drawing-room she wishes to attend. She must bring
with her two similar cards on the evening of the Drawing-room,
one to be given to the official in the Corridor, and the
other to the Chamberlain, who will announce the name.</p>

<p>A lady on entering the Castle on the evening of a Drawing-room
towards ten o'clock, finds the hall lined with
soldiers, and repairs at once to the cloak-room to leave
wraps, etc., and to have her train dexterously arranged over
one arm by a female attendant. She then proceeds up the
grand staircase, lined with servants in gorgeous liveries,
and enters the Corridor, where one of the Presentation
Cards is given up to the official in attendance, and she
passes down the Corridor into the Long Drawing-room, where
a barrier of wood, enclosing a space, is erected at the end.
One of the gentlemen of the Household lifts this barrier at
intervals to allow of a certain number passing through to
the Throne-room, at the door of which her train is let
down and arranged by men-servants. If she is to be "presented,"
the Chamberlain tells her to take off her right-hand
glove, and, if royalty is present, informs her that
she must make three bows, and says, "Three bows, please."
She gives up her second Presentation Card to him, and he
calls out her name, and it is passed along to His Excellency
by the gentlemen of the household. The Lord-Lieutenant
and his wife stand on a da&iuml;s, he standing in front of the
Throne, which is a grand chair of State, and on either side&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
what are known as the "Pens"&mdash;are grouped the
visitors staying at the Castle, those who have the private
<i>entr&eacute;e</i>, and the members of the Household. The name of
the lady who makes the presentation is also called out.
The lady presented advances, the Lord-Lieutenant shakes
hands with her, but does not now kiss her on the cheek;
she then makes him a bow, and bows to his wife, who bows
in return. She then retires back to the door leading into
the Long Drawing-room, where her train is replaced over
her arm. She then proceeds to St. Patrick's Hall, or to the
Picture Gallery.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Ladies who attend</big></b> the Drawing-room only bow to
the Lord-Lieutenant and his wife; he bows to them, but he
does not shake hands with them or kiss them. In Ireland
men invariably accompany their wives to the Drawing-room,
having previously attended the Lev&eacute;e; they pass along the
base of the semi-circle, and make their bows at the same
time as do the ladies.</p>

<p>When all have been received and have assembled in St.
Patrick's Hall, a procession is formed, the Lord-Lieutenant
walking first, followed by his wife, whose train is carried by
pages. The visitors staying at the Castle follow next, and
then the members of the Household, the band stationed in
the gallery playing "God Save the King" the while. All
those present form up in two lines to make a passage for the
procession to pass through, and bow low to His Excellency
and his wife as they pass.</p>

<p>A supper is not given, only light refreshments of every
description. These refreshments are arranged on long
tables on one side of St. Patrick's Hall, and at the lower
end, under the gallery, tables are placed for tea, coffee,
wine, etc. On the opposite side of the hall red-cushioned
seats are placed, and the company promenade in and around
the Picture Gallery and St. Patrick's Hall during the remainder
of the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Ladies wear full Court dress as at Buckingham Palace,
and gentlemen uniform or Court dress.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Lev&eacute;es.</big></b>&mdash;Every nobleman or gentleman who proposes
to attend a Lev&eacute;e, and who has not yet been received at
the Viceregal Court, must be introduced by a nobleman
or gentleman who has himself been previously presented
thereat.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Gentleman who proposes</big></b> to be presented must
send to the Gentleman Usher's office by five o'clock, two or
three days before the Lev&eacute;e, a card with his name and
address, both in town and country, and the name and
address of the gentleman by whom he is to be presented
distinctly written thereon, to be submitted for the Lord-Lieutenant's
approval. He must also obtain two Presentation
Cards from the Gentleman Usher's office, and must
take them to the Castle on the day of the Lev&eacute;e, the one
to be given to the official in the Corridor, and the other to
be handed to the Gentleman Usher, who will announce the
name to the Lord-Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Any gentleman who proposes to attend a Lev&eacute;e, having
been previously presented, must also take two cards with
him to the Castle on the day of the Lev&eacute;e, with his name
and address, both in town and country, clearly written
thereon, to be given up as before mentioned. Again, a
gentleman who, having previously attended the Lev&eacute;e, proposes
attending the Drawing-room, is requested to bring
with him <i>one</i> card, with his name distinctly written upon it,
to be left in the Corridor. All those entitled to the private
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> at Dublin Castle, and availing themselves of the
privilege, are permitted to be accompanied only by their
wives and unmarried daughters.</p>

<p>Gentlemen wear Court dress or naval and military uniforms,
or the uniforms of Lords-Lieutenants of Counties, or
of the Royal Irish Constabulary, etc. The Academical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
habit cannot be worn except when presenting an address
from a university. Foreign orders and decorations cannot
be worn at the Court of Dublin by British subjects without
special authority under His Majesty's royal licence.</p>

<p>The right-hand glove should be removed before
Presentation.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who, having previously attended the Lev&eacute;e,
are desirous of accompanying the ladies of their families
to the Drawing-room, are requested to apply to the
Chamberlain's office for an Attendance Card, which should
be brought to the Castle on the evening of the Drawing-room
and given up in the Corridor.</p>

<p>Presentations in London do not count as Presentations
at the Viceregal Court.</p>

<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<h3>HOSTESSES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>The Art of receiving Guests</big></b> is a very subtle one,
difficult to acquire; but when acquired and thoroughly
mastered it confers upon a mistress of a house an enviable
reputation&mdash;that of being a perfect hostess.</p>

<p>With some this is in-bred, and grace and composure
and all the attendant attributes which are to be found in
this type of hostess sit naturally upon them; but the individuals
so gifted represent the few rather than the many.
A far greater section of society has to rely upon experience
to teach them this useful accomplishment, while with others
time alone can aid them in overcoming natural reserve,
and want of confidence in themselves, which stand in the
way of their assuming this character with anything like
success. Those ladies who are innately thoughtless and
careless in this respect, neither time nor experience can
mould, and what they are at the commencement of their
career, they remain to the end of the chapter&mdash;very indifferent
hostesses. There are varieties of hostesses,
according to individual capabilities, and who are known
amongst their friends by these appellations: first ranks the
perfect or "charming hostess," either title suits her equally
well; next to her comes the "good hostess," she is followed
by the one who is "not a good hostess"; and the rear
is brought up by the one who is decidedly "a bad hostess."
Amongst the salient points which distinguish the perfect or
charming hostess are perhaps, foremost, a certain facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
of putting each individual guest at ease, conveying that
the welcome she accords is a personal if not an especial
one. Simultaneously with these agreeable impressions is
conveyed a sense of the hostess's genial qualities; her
charm of manner, her graciousness and her courteous
bearing evincing so plainly that she is entirely mistress
of the situation: these qualities insensibly react upon the
guests, and evoke a corresponding desire to please on their
part.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The perfect hostess</big></b> possesses yet another advantage,
viz. a readiness of speech, a faculty of saying the right
thing at the right moment and to the right person, and
of identifying herself, so to speak, with the susceptibilities
of each of her guests.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The good hostess</big></b> is essentially what is known as a
considerate hostess; she makes up for the brighter qualities
in which she is lacking by her extreme consideration for her
guests. In the charming hostess this consideration is eclipsed
by her more brilliant powers of pleasing, it permeates all she
does, while in the good hostess it is her strongest point,
and upon which is founded her claim to the name. The
lady who bears the undesirable reputation of being "not
a good hostess" is not "good" in a variety of ways;
she means well and does her utmost to succeed, but by
some contrariety of the laws which regulate domestic
and social affairs, the results of her efforts are always the
reverse of what she would have them be. The lady who
is not a good hostess sometimes suffers from shyness
and reserve which renders her stiff in manner when she
would most desire to be cordial, silent when she would
be most loquacious, and awkward when she would be at
ease.</p>

<p>As there are many reasons why ladies prove to be good
hostesses, so there are many reasons why they prove bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
hostesses, selfishness and want of consideration for others
contribute to these, as do procrastination and a vague idea
of the value of time. Ladies with such faults and weaknesses
as these produce very much the same impression
upon their guests, although, perhaps, one is a little less
culpable than is the other.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The selfish hostess is a bad hostess</big></b>, because,
providing she is amused, she is utterly indifferent as to
whether her guests are amused or not, her own pleasure and
gratification being of paramount importance. Instead of
being in readiness to receive her guests she descends late to
the drawing-room to welcome them, and is indifferent as
to whether there is any one to greet them or not.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The procrastinating hostess</big></b>, although she is equally
in fault, yet, as she hastens to excuse herself, when lacking
in politeness to, or consideration for her guests, her excuses
are sometimes admitted; but the selfish hostess, if she
deigns to excuse herself, does so with such a palpable show
of indifference as to her guests' opinion of her actions, that
the excuse is oftener than not an aggravation of the offence.
A lady who has no regard for time goes to her room to
dress at the moment when she should be descending to the
drawing-room; or she remains out driving when she should
be returning; or she puts off making some very important
arrangement for the comfort or amusement of her guests
until it is too late for anything but a makeshift to be
thought of, if it has not to be dispensed with altogether.
Everything that she does or projects is on the same scale of
procrastination; her invitations, her orders and engagements,
are one and all effected against time, and neither
herself nor her guests gain the value or satisfaction of the
hospitality put forth. The bad hostess walks into her
drawing-room when many of her guests are assembled,
either for a dinner-party or afternoon tea, and shakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
hands in an awkward, abashed manner, almost as if she
were an unexpected guest instead of the mistress of the
house.</p>

<p>The host is not at his ease; he is provoked at having
to make excuses for his wife, and the guests are equally
constrained.</p>

<p>If the host is of a sarcastic turn of mind, he never
refrains from saying something the reverse of amiable to
the hostess on her entrance. "My dear," he will perhaps
remark, "you are doubtless not aware that we have friends
dining with us this evening." This remark renders the
guests even more uncomfortable and the hostess less self-possessed,
and this is often the prelude to an inharmonious
evening, with a host whose brow is clouded and a hostess
whose manner is abashed.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The mode of receiving guests</big></b> is determined by the
nature of the entertainment. A welcome accorded to some
two or three hundred guests cannot be as personal a one as
that offered to some ten to thirty guests.</p>

<p>Whatever disappointment a hostess may feel she should
not allow it to appear on the surface, and should not be
<i>distrait</i> in manner when shaking hands with her guests.
At large or small gatherings disappointments follow in the
course of events, and very few hostesses can say that they
have not experienced this in a larger or smaller degree at
each and all of their entertainments.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>At a ball or evening-party</big></b> a hostess should receive
her guests at the head of the staircase, and should remain there
until the majority, if not all, of the guests have arrived.</p>

<p>As the names of the guests are announced the hostess
should shake hands with each, addressing some courteous
observation the while, not with a view of inducing them to
linger on the staircase, but rather of inviting them to enter
the ball-room to make way for other guests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>At a ball given at a country house the hostess should
stand at the door of the ball-room and receive her guests.
When the guests have duly arrived, a hostess at a country-house
ball or country-house theatricals should exert herself
to see that all her guests are amused. If she sees that the
young ladies are not dancing she should endeavour to find
them partners. In town she is not required to do this. If
the chaperons have apparently no one to talk to she should
introduce one of her own relatives, if she cannot give much
of her own attention to them, and she should arrange that
all her guests are taken in to supper.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>At large afternoon "at homes"</big></b> the hostess receives
her guests at the open door of the drawing-room, and has
little more time to bestow upon each than at a ball or an
"at home." At small afternoon "at homes" she should
receive them in the drawing-room, and should rise and
shake hands with each arrival.</p>

<p>A hostess should receive her dinner guests in the drawing-room,
and should shake hands with each in the order of
arrival. She occasionally finds it a trying ordeal to sustain
conversation between the arrival of dinner guests and the
dinner being served; sometimes this is prolonged for three-quarters
of an hour through the non-appearance of a guest
who must be waited for. A hostess should, although she
knows that her dinner is spoilt by being thus kept back,
endeavour to make the time pass as pleasantly as possible,
by rendering the conversation general and by making the
guests acquainted with each other. The hostess who can
tide over these awkward occurrences so that the postponement
of dinner from half to three-quarters of an hour is
hardly perceived, proves herself to be entitled to be considered
a good hostess.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<h3>THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF LADY PATRONESSES OF PUBLIC
BALLS</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Ladies are frequently solicited</big></b> to allow their names to
be placed on the lists of lady patronesses of charity balls.
A ball committee is desirous of obtaining a list of influential
names to lend <i>&eacute;clat</i> and prestige to the ball, and a charity
ball often numbers amongst its lady patronesses the names
of many of the leading members of the nobility, followed
by those of the wives of the leading county gentry, or by
the principal residents of a watering-place or county town;
but it is understood, as a rule, that the duty of giving
vouchers or tickets for a charity ball is undertaken by those
ladies who are more directly interested in it, whose
husbands are on the committee, who make a point of
annually attending it, and thus are principally concerned
in keeping it select; and although in many counties and
in many towns lady patronesses, members of the nobility,
do attend, yet it not unfrequently happens that out of a
long list of great ladies only three or four are present at
a ball.</p>

<p>The members of the leading nobility and gentry of a
neighbourhood invariably lend their names to local charity
balls, and head the list of patrons and patronesses, but
beyond lending their names, and in some cases sending a
subscription of money towards the funds of the charity, or
a present of game towards the supper, they have very little
to do with the ball itself, which is practically in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of the local stewards. The exceptions to this rule are the
charity balls held in town during the season, such as the
Royal Caledonian Ball, the Yorkshire, the Wiltshire, and
the Somersetshire Societies' Balls. On these occasions
many of the great ladies give vouchers and attend the
balls.</p>

<p>When ladies consent to become lady patronesses of a
ball, they usually notify to the committee whether they will
or will not undertake the duty of giving vouchers or tickets,
as the case may be. Some ball committees arrange that
vouchers are to be given by lady patronesses, to be subsequently
exchanged for tickets, signed and filled in with the
name of the person to whom the ticket is given. The lady
patronesses in this case receive the money charged for the
tickets, and forward it to the committee after the ball, with
any tickets that they may not have disposed of.</p>

<p>The ladies who exert themselves to sell tickets are
generally those who possess a large acquaintance, whose
husbands are members of clubs; therefore, if any person
ought to be tabooed for some good social reason, the
lady patronesses reap the benefit of their husbands' knowledge,
and are thus able to give a polite refusal when
tickets are applied for for persons who are not altogether
desirable.</p>

<p>It is no doubt a difficult and delicate task for the lady
patronesses of a large ball to keep it thoroughly select, and
if not very particular respecting those for whom tickets are
granted, a ball, though a full one, is likely to prove a very
mixed affair, if not somewhat objectionable, by reason of
the presence of persons to whom tickets should never have
been granted, on moral if not on social grounds; and
though the funds of a charity may gain considerably by
the increase of numbers, through a general willingness on
the part of the committee or the lady patronesses to grant
tickets to every one who may apply for them, yet such
policy is very short-sighted, and is seldom practised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
those who possess any practical knowledge in the matter,
as it is fatal to the reputation of a ball if persons who are
objectionable are present at it.</p>

<p>In the case of a ticket being applied for for a person of
doubtful antecedents, a lady patroness's best course is to
refer the applicant to the ball committee for tickets or
vouchers.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Persons not well received in society</big></b>, or who have
ostracised themselves, have a predilection for public balls,
and make every effort to obtain tickets of admission; and
in some cases, when a refusal has been pronounced by the
committee of a ball, the committee has been threatened with
legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Unmarried ladies seldom or ever act as lady patronesses,
it not being considered advisable to place the discretion of
granting tickets in their hands, lest their ignorance of the
world should be taken advantage of.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The lady patronesses of a charity ball</big></b> who undertake
to give vouchers or to sell tickets, usually exert
themselves to the utmost in inducing as many of their
friends as possible to attend the ball.</p>

<p>It depends upon the committee of a charity ball whether
tickets are presented or not to the lady patronesses and
stewards; but if the funds of the charity are not at a
very low ebb, this is generally done in recognition of their
services.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of lady patronesses of private subscription
balls are light in comparison with those of public
charity balls, as persons who attend subscription balls are
usually on the visiting lists of one or other of the lady
patronesses, while with regard to county balls, lady patronesses
are not usually concerned in the disposal of the
tickets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>

<h3>PERIODS OF MOURNING</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>The Various Periods of Mourning</big></b> for relatives have
within the last few years been materially shortened, and
the change generally accepted; but as some still prefer to
adhere to the longest periods prescribed by custom, in the
present chapter both periods are given, and it entirely
depends upon individual feeling and circumstances which
of the two periods is observed.</p>

<p>The time-honoured custom of wearing crape has greatly
declined, and with the exception of widows, many do not
wear it at all, while others wear it as a trimming only.</p>

<p>A slighter change has also taken place in favour of half-mourning
colours, which are now more worn than black and
white during the half-mourning period.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Court Mourning</big></b> when enjoined is imperative, the
orders respecting which are minutely given from the Lord
Chamberlain's office and published in the official <i>Gazette</i>;
but these orders only apply to persons connected with the
Court, or to persons attending Courts, Lev&eacute;es, State Balls,
State Concerts, etc.</p>

<p>When the order for general mourning is given on the
death of any member of the Royal Family, the order applies
to all, although it is optional whether the general public
comply with it or not.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Longest Period for a Widow's Mourning</big></b>
is two years. The shorter period is eighteen months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Formerly crape was worn for one year and nine months;
for the first twelve months the dress was entirely covered
with crape. The newer fashion in widows' mourning is to
wear crape as a trimming only, and to discontinue its wear
after six or eight months, while some few widows do not
wear it at all during their mourning, it being optional
wear.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Half-Mourning</big></b> in the longer period commences after
a year and nine months, and is worn for three months. In
the shorter period half-mourning may commence after
fifteen months, and be continued for three months.</p>

<p>The period for wearing the widow's cap and veil is a
year and a day. The veil may be <i>cr&ecirc;pe lisse</i> or <i>chiffon</i> in
place of crape. It is now the fashion for young widows to
wear the cap as a head-dress only, while others do not wear
it at all.</p>

<p>Lawn cuffs and collars are worn during the first year, or
for six months only, or not at all. After the first year white
neckbands and white strings to the bonnet may be worn.
Also hats in place of bonnets. Further touches of white
may follow during the next three months.</p>

<p>After a year gold ornaments may be worn; diamonds
earlier.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Widowers</big></b> should wear mourning for one year; they
usually enter society after three months.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Parent</big></b> the period of mourning is twelve
months; ten months black, two months half-mourning, or
eight months black and four months half-mourning. The
black may be relieved with touches of white after three
months. Crape is optional; many prefer not to wear it at
all, others as a trimming.</p>

<p>Diamonds&mdash;earrings, brooches; etc.&mdash;before gold, at the
end of three months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Son or Daughter</big></b> the period of mourning is
identical with the foregoing.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For very Young Children or Infants</big></b> the mourning
is frequently shortened by half this period, or even to three
months.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Stepmother.</big></b>&mdash;The period of mourning depends
upon whether the stepdaughters reside at home or not,
or whether their father has been long married, or whether
their father's second wife has filled the place of mother to
them, in which case the period of mourning would be for
twelve months, otherwise the period is six months&mdash;four
months black relieved with touches of white after two
months, followed by two months half-mourning.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Brother or Sister</big></b> the longest period of mourning
is six months, the shortest period four months.</p>

<p>During the longest period, viz. six months, black should
be worn for five months, with a little white after two months,
half-mourning for one month. After one month diamonds,
pins, and brooches, etc.; gold after two months.</p>

<p>During the shortest period, viz. four months, black
should be worn for two months, half-mourning two months.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Sister-in-law or a Brother-in-law</big></b> the
period of mourning was formerly the same as for a brother
or sister, but the four months' period is now the one usually
chosen.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Grandparent</big></b> the longest period of mourning is
six months, the shortest four months.</p>

<p>During the longest period black should be worn for
three months, relieved with white after six weeks, half-mourning
for three months; diamonds after one month,
gold after six weeks or two months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>During the shortest period black should be worn for two
months, half-mourning for two months.</p>

<p>The custom of wearing crape may now be said to
have gone out of fashion as regards etiquette, black being
considered adequate mourning, save in the case of
widows.</p>

<p>The former crape periods were six months for parents
and children, three months for brothers and sisters, three
months for grandparents.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For an Uncle or Aunt</big></b> the longest period of mourning
is three months, the shortest period six weeks.</p>

<p>During the longest period black (no crape) should be
worn for two months, half-mourning one month.</p>

<p>During the shortest period black for three weeks,
half-mourning for three weeks; diamonds after three
weeks.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Nephew or Niece</big></b> the periods of mourning
are identical with the foregoing.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For an Uncle or Aunt by Marriage</big></b> the period is
six weeks black, or three weeks black and three weeks half-mourning.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Great Uncle or Aunt</big></b> the longest period is
two months, the shortest one month.</p>

<p>During the longest period black for one month, half-mourning
for one month.</p>

<p>During the shortest period black for one month.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a First Cousin</big></b> the longest period is six weeks,
the shortest one month.</p>

<p>During the longest period black for three weeks, half-mourning
for three weeks.</p>

<p>During the shortest period black for one month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Second Cousin</big></b> three weeks black. Mourning
for a second cousin is not obligatory, but quite optional,
and often not worn.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Husband's Relations</big></b> the periods of mourning
chosen are invariably the shorter ones.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Daughter-in-law or Son-in-law</big></b> the periods
are now shortened to six months; four months black and
two months half-mourning, or three months black and
three months half-mourning.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For the Parents of a Son-in-law or Daughter-in-law</big></b>
the period is one month, black.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For the Parents of a First Wife</big></b> a second wife
should wear mourning for one month, black relieved with
white.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Brother or Sister of a First Wife</big></b> a second
wife should wear mourning for three weeks, but this is not
obligatory, and depends upon the intimacy existing between
the two families.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Much Latitude is allowed to Men</big></b> with regard to
the foregoing periods of mourning.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Hat-band should be worn</big></b> during the whole of
each period, but it is not imperative to wear suits of black
longer than half the periods given, save in the case of
widowers.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Servants' Mourning.</big></b>&mdash;It is customary to give servants
mourning on the death of the head of the house, which
should be worn during the period the members of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
are in mourning. Mourning given to servants on the
death of a son or daughter is quite an optional matter.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Seclusion from Society.</big></b>&mdash;The question as to how
soon persons in mourning should or should not re-enter
society is in some measure an open one, and is also influenced
by the rules that govern the actual period of
mourning adopted.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Widow is not expected to enter into Society</big></b>
under three months, and during that time she should neither
accept invitations nor issue them. Her visiting should be
confined to her relations and intimate friends. After three
months she should commence gradually to enter into
society, but balls and dances should be avoided during
the first year.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Daughter mourning for a Parent</big></b> the period
of seclusion is six weeks as far as general society is concerned;
but invitations to balls and dances should not be
accepted until after six months.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Parent mourning for a Son or Daughter</big></b>
the period of seclusion is the same as is that of a daughter
for a parent.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For a Brother or Sister</big></b> the period of seclusion is
three weeks.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For Grandparents</big></b> the period of seclusion is from
a fortnight to three weeks.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For an Uncle or Aunt</big></b> the period is a fortnight to
three weeks.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>For all Other Periods of Mourning</big></b> seclusion from
society is not considered requisite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When Persons in Mourning</big></b> intend entering again
into society, they should leave cards on their friends and
acquaintances as an intimation that they are equal to paying
and receiving calls.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When Cards of Inquiry have been left</big></b>, viz.
visiting cards with "To inquire after Mrs. A&mdash;&mdash;" written
on the top on right-hand corner of the cards, they should
be returned by cards with "Thanks for kind inquiries"
written upon them (see <a href="#Page_19">Chapter III</a>.).</p>

<p>Until this intimation has been given, society does not
venture to intrude upon the seclusion of those in mourning.</p>

<p>Relations and intimate friends are exempt from this
received rule.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Funerals.</big></b>&mdash;When a death occurs in a family, as soon
as the day and hour for the funeral are fixed, a member of
the family should write to those relatives and friends it is
desired should follow, and should ask them to attend, unless
the date, time, and place of the funeral, and the train by
which to travel to the cemetery, are mentioned in the newspaper,
together with the announcement of the death.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is a Mistake to suppose that Friends</big></b> will offer
to attend a funeral, even if they are aware of the date fixed,
as they are naturally in doubt as to whether the mourners
are to include the members of the family only, or whether
friends are to be included also.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>In the Country, when a Doctor</big></b> has attended a
family for some years, it is usual to invite him to attend
the funeral of one of its members. In town this is seldom
done, unless a medical man is the intimate friend of the
family.</p>

<p>In the country the clergyman of the parish reads the
funeral service, but in town, when the funeral takes place
at Kensal Green, Brookwood Cemetery, or elsewhere, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
friend of the family is usually asked to officiate; in which
case it is necessary to make an early application at the office
of the cemetery for the use of the chapel at a particular
hour.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>It is customary for Ladies to attend</big></b> the funeral
of a relative if disposed to do so, in which case they wear
their usual mourning attire, and follow in their own
carriages.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Doctor's Certificate</big></b> as to the cause of death is
of primary importance, and should be obtained at the earliest
possible moment.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Memorial Cards should not be sent</big></b> on the death
of a relative, being quite out of date as regards fashion and
custom.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Wreaths and Crosses</big></b> of white flowers are very
generally sent by relatives and friends to a house of
mourning the day of the funeral, unless "No flowers, by
request" follows the announcement of the death.</p>

<p>When the funeral takes place before two o'clock, the
friends should be invited to luncheon. When it takes place
in the afternoon, they should be asked to return to the house
for tea or light refreshment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

<h3>ENGAGED</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> greatly depends upon the views held by parents as to
the freedom of action accorded to a daughter during her
engagement. Some entertain the strictest ideas on this
head, and strenuously put them in force.</p>

<p>By "strict ideas" is meant that an engaged couple,
except in the presence of a chaperon, are never, under any
circumstances, permitted to enjoy a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, sit together,
walk together, ride together, or meet during any part of
the day.</p>

<p>Wisdom and common-sense dictate a middle course of
action for the consideration of parents, neither granting too
much nor withholding too much.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The length of an engagement</big></b> determines in most
instances the degree of latitude allowed. If it is to last two
months, or even less, it is usual to permit the engaged couple
to be much in each other's society. The circumstances
under which this is accomplished depend upon the position
of the parents; if wealthy, and a country house is part of
their possessions, the young lady's father should invite the
gentleman engaged to his daughter on a visit, or one or two
visits, during the engagement.</p>

<p>Or the mother of the bridegroom-elect should invite her
future daughter-in-law to stay with her for ten days or a
fortnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Etiquette prescribes that a young lady must be chaperoned
by one of her near relatives at all public places of
amusement.</p>

<p>If an engaged couple move in the same set, they meet
frequently at the houses of mutual friends; they are sent in
to dinner together when dining out.</p>

<p>To dance with each other at a ball, or dance more than
three or four times in succession, and when not dancing
to sit out in tea-rooms and conservatories, renders an
engaged couple conspicuous, and this is precisely what
many mothers are most anxious that their daughters should
avoid being, and would rather that they were over-prudent
than that they should run the gauntlet of general
criticism.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The usual course for engaged couples</big></b> to take is
to go as little into society as possible during their engagement,
and to make the engagement as brief as circumstances
will permit. If from various causes it must of necessity be
a long one, the only alternative for an engaged couple is to
render themselves as little conspicuous in general society as
a mutual understanding will permit.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>When an engagement is first announced</big></b>, if the
families are not previously acquainted, the father, mother,
and relatives of the bridegroom-elect should call on the
father and mother of the bride-elect at an early date, to
make the acquaintance of the bride and her family, and
they should write to the bride-elect expressing their approval
of the engagement.</p>

<p>The calls should be returned and the letters answered
with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>The engagement should be announced to relatives and
intimate friends by the mother of the engaged young lady,
and if the announcement is to appear in the papers it should
be sent by her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The bride should ask the sisters and cousins of the
bridegroom to act as bridesmaids in conjunction with her
own sisters and cousins.</p>

<p>When an engagement is broken off, all letters and
presents should be returned on both sides.</p>

<p>All wedding presents received by the bride-elect should
be likewise returned to the donors.</p>

<p>The mother of the bride should announce to all whom
it may concern, the fact that the engagement is at an end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

<h3>SILVER WEDDINGS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> German custom of celebrating Silver Weddings has
become thoroughly recognised in this country. It is an
interesting custom to celebrate the first twenty-five years of
married life under the poetic title of a Silver Wedding, but
those who can do so must be for many reasons the few,
rather than the many; Royal personages, and distinguished
and prominent ones for instance, and again, those in humbler
walks of life "far from the madding crowd," are also
inclined to do so; but the "crowd" that divides them,
formed of different classes and different sets in society, will
hardly avail itself of the opportunity of celebrating this
period of married life. Husbands as a rule dislike the fuss
and parade and prominency it entails, and wives are disinclined
to announce to their friends and acquaintances
that they have been married five and twenty years, and are
consequently not so young as they were.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The entertainments given to celebrate a Silver
Wedding</big></b> are: An afternoon reception and a dinner-party.
A dinner-party followed by an evening-party. A dinner-party
followed by a dance. Or a dinner-party only, of
some twenty or thirty covers.</p>

<p>The invitations are issued on "at home" cards some
three weeks beforehand, the cards being printed in silver,
and the words "Mr. and Mrs. White at home, To celebrate
their Silver Wedding" printed on them, with day and date,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
etc. The dinner cards should also be printed in silver,
with the words "Mr. and Mrs. White request the pleasure
of Mr. and Mrs. Black's company at dinner to celebrate
their Silver Wedding," etc.</p>

<p>For a dance the invitations should be worded "Mr. and
Mrs. White at home, To celebrate their Silver Wedding."
"Dancing" printed in the corner of the card.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Each person invited</big></b> is expected to send a present in
silver, costly or trifling as the case may be, whether the
invitation is accepted or not. These presents should be
exhibited in the drawing-room on the day of the Silver
Wedding with a card attached to each bearing the name of
the giver.</p>

<p>At the afternoon reception the husband and wife receive
the congratulations of their friends as they arrive. They
enter the tea-room together almost immediately afterwards
followed by those guests who have arrived. Refreshments
are served as at an afternoon wedding tea. (See page <a href="#Page_143">143</a>.)
A large wedding-cake is placed in the centre of the table,
and the wife makes the first cut in it as a bride would do.
The health of the husband and wife is then proposed by
one of the guests, drunk in champagne, and responded to
by the husband.</p>

<p>At the dinner-party the husband and wife go in to dinner
together, followed by their guests, who are sent in according
to precedency. The health of the husband and wife is
proposed at dessert and responded to. A wedding-cake
occupies a prominent place on the table, and the dinner-table
decorations consist of white flowers interspersed with
silver.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>At the Silver Wedding dance</big></b>, the husband and wife
dance the first dance together, and subsequently lead the
way into the supper-room arm-in-arm, and later on their
health is proposed by the principal guest present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The wife should wear white and silver, or grey and
silver.</p>

<p>In the country, when a Silver Wedding is celebrated, the
festivities sometimes range over three days, but this only in
the case of prominent and wealthy people; balls, dinners,
and school-treats being given, in which the neighbours,
tenants, villagers and servants take part.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Golden Weddings.</big></b>&mdash;The celebration of a Golden
Wedding is rather an English custom, and one that from
circumstances can be but seldom observed. It denotes
that fifty years of married life have passed over the heads
of husband and wife, and is a solemn rather than a festive
epoch. Presents on this occasion are not so generally
given, and children and grandchildren rather than acquaintances
make up the circle of those who offer congratulations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>

<h3>SUBSCRIPTION DANCES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Subscription</big></b> dances are now an established fact, but
whether they will ever really become a rival to the dance
proper remains to be seen; yet as they supply a want felt,
and are recognised by society, the arrangements necessary
for carrying them out should be duly noted.</p>

<p>During the winter months they are a feature in certain
sets: Subscription dances, private Subscription dances and
public Subscription dances, the latter got up for charitable
purposes.</p>

<p>The moderate expenses incurred by giving private
Subscription dances commend them to many, and there are
other reasons to account for their popularity. They are
without pretension to being considered smart or exclusive,
and are essentially small and early dances. Fashionable
ball-goers are not expected to attend them. They commence
at 9 o'clock and terminate at 12, light refreshments
in lieu of supper are provided, as at an afternoon
"at home." (See p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a>.) A piano band is considered
sufficient for the purpose, and floral decorations are scarcely
ever attempted. The invitations are issued on "at home"
cards, with the words "Subscription Dance" printed in one
corner.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Subscription</big></b> dances are sometimes invitation dances
and sometimes not. Tickets for these dances are charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
for singly or by the series as the case may be. A certain
number of ladies form a committee and agree to give a
certain number of dances, and the expenses are either
borne by the ladies themselves or covered by the sale of
the tickets. If invitation dances, a certain number of
invitations are allotted to each lady. When otherwise, the
ladies dispose of the tickets among their friends. These
dances are usually held in a mansion hired for the purpose,
and there are several available in different parts of the
West End, where spacious rooms can be hired on very
moderate terms; in some instances a piano, seats, and other
accessories are also included.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Public Subscription</big></b> dances are held in public rooms
or Town Halls, and vouchers are given by ladies on the
committee previous to tickets being granted.</p>

<p>The same etiquette holds good at Subscription dances
as at other public dances. The early hour at which these
dances take place recommends them to some and altogether
renders them impossible to others, notably to
those who dine late, and who are not inclined to dance
at nine o'clock or even at ten o'clock, and who rather
resent the frugal style of refreshments offered, and consider
that a champagne supper is an indispensable adjunct to a
dance.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that Subscription dances were
first originated for the amusement of very young people,
and it was never expected that they would compete with
the fashionable small dances of the day; their popularity
was a surprise, and if ball-goers are disposed to hold them
in contempt there are others less fashionable and less
wealthy who find them very much to their taste.</p>

<p>The great difficulty, however, that ladies have to contend
with is the fact that very few men can be induced to attend
them, and that those who do accept invitations or purchase
tickets are very young men, who have their way to make in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the world, and are as yet on the lower rungs of the ladder,
and as young ladies are very much in the majority at these
Subscription dances, to dance with partners younger than
themselves is an almost inevitable result for those who are
no longer in their teens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

<h3>GIVING PRESENTS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">As</span> regards presents in general it should be understood
that a present demands a note of thanks in all cases when
the thanks cannot be verbally expressed. The notes to
slight acquaintances should be written in the third person.
To friends, in the first person. This applies equally to
presents of game, poultry, fruit, or flowers. Some few
people entertain the erroneous idea that presents of this
nature do not require thanks. This is not only ungracious
but raises a doubt in the mind of the giver as to whether
the present sent has been duly received.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Wedding Presents.</big></b>&mdash;When an engagement has been
duly announced to relatives and friends, and it is understood
that it is to be a short one, wedding presents may be
sent until the day before the wedding-day, and the earlier
they are sent the more convenient it is for the bride, as she
is expected to write a note of thanks to each giver. In
each case a letter should be sent with the present expressing
the congratulations and best wishes of the donor, and, if
possible, a card with the name of the giver should be
attached to it for identification when the presents are
exhibited.</p>

<p>The friends of the bridegroom, and unacquainted with
the bride, should send their presents to him, and he should
send them to the house of the bride's mother after having
written notes of thanks to the givers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Christening Presents.</big></b>&mdash;With regard to christening
presents the godfathers and godmothers are expected to
make presents to their godchild; these should be sent the
day before the christening, and should consist of a silver
mug and silver fork and spoon from the godfathers, while
a lace robe or handsome cloak are usual presents from the
godmothers. A present of money from 5<i>s.</i> to &pound;1 should
be made to the nurse on the day of the christening when
the godparents are relatives, but oftener than not the
sponsors are represented by proxy.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Giving Tips to Servants.</big></b>&mdash;The tips expected from
ladies at the conclusion of a visit of some days, are: To
the head housemaid from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> according to the
length of the visit. The same to the butler or single-handed
man-servant, and the same to the chauffeur. Young
ladies give less when visiting by themselves.</p>

<p>The tips expected from gentlemen are: To the butler
or footman who valets them, to the chauffeur if he drives
them to and from the station, to the groom if he takes
charge of their hunters, also to the head housemaid. The
tip to the butler or footman who acts as valet is for a long
visit from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>, and for a short visit from 3<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>
To the chauffeur 5<i>s.</i> in the first case, and from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
5<i>s.</i> in the second. To the housemaid, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> For
tips to gamekeeper, see p. <a href="#Page_223">223</a>.</p>

<p>The tips given to hotel servants vary according to the
length of the visit. To the head waiter from 5<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>
To the second waiter from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> To the hall porter,
2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> To the luggage porter, 1<i>s.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> To the head
housemaid in attendance, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

<h3>CHRISTENING PARTIES</h3>

<p class="noin"><b><big>Christening Parties</big></b> may be said to be strictly family
gatherings, only the near relatives of the parents being
invited on these occasions.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Invitations</big></b> are given in friendly notes, and are
not issued on "at home" cards. The notice averages from a
week to ten days according to circumstances, meaning the
health and strength of the infant's mother.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>As a Rule Six Weeks</big></b> are allowed to elapse between
the birth of the child and the date of the christening.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Relatives are either invited</big></b> to luncheon after
the ceremony, or to a reception tea, or to a dinner-party to
be given the same evening. If a luncheon is decided upon
it generally takes place at 1.30, or earlier, immediately on
the return from the church. The meal usually consists of
hot viands&mdash;game or poultry&mdash;not substantial joints. Hot
and cold sweets. Fruit to follow. A smart christening
cake should occupy the centre of the table. Champagne,
claret, and sherry are given, although the former is probably
the only one of the three drunk on the occasion; this, when
the health of the infant is proposed&mdash;the only health which
finds acceptance at these gatherings.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Guests go in to Luncheon</big></b> quite informally,
the ladies and hostess entering first, followed by the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
guests and the host. They should be seated at table by the
help of name cards, each lady being placed at the right
hand of a gentleman. The clergyman who performs the
ceremony, if a friend, should sit at the hostess's left hand,
and should be asked to say grace; but in town he seldom
joins these family gatherings unless well acquainted with his
parishioners.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>A Reception Tea</big></b>, when given, is served in the dining-room;
but in this case the guests are received on arrival by
the hostess in the drawing-room, and when all have arrived,
she accompanies them to the tea-room and remains there
with them. The maid-servants should pour out and hand
the tea and coffee across the tea-table, but the hostess
should hand the cakes, etc., to her relatives, assisted by the
host, if present. The refreshments consist of the usual
variety in confectionery seen at all smart "at homes," a
christening cake being the addition.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Christening Dinner-Parties</big></b> closely resemble all
other family functions of this nature, with the exception
that the infant's health is drunk at dessert, and that a
christening cake is placed opposite the hostess when the
table is cleared for dessert.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>The Christening Ceremony</big></b> takes place in the
afternoon, usually at 2.30. The relatives on arrival at the
church seat themselves in pews or on chairs near to
the font. The godmother holds the infant during the
first part of the service, and then places it on the left arm
of the officiating clergyman. One of the godfathers should
name the child in response to the clergyman's question.
If the child is a girl, two godmothers and one godfather
are necessary. If a boy, two godfathers and one godmother
are required. These godparents are usually the intimate
friends of the child's mother. In certain instances the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
relatives are chosen for the office of godfather and godmother,
but oftener not for family reasons.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Christening Presents</big></b> vary according to means and
inclination, and often comprise gifts of jewellery when the
infant is a girl, and money and silver plate if a boy; silver
spoons, forks, mugs, bowls, etc. The selection is a wide
one, and nothing comes amiss, from a robe with fine lace
to a chain and pendant or a jewelled watch. These
presents are usually sent the day previous to that of the
christening.</p>

<p class="mt2"><b><big>Fees and Tips.</big></b>&mdash;Only minor fees are given to those
assisting at the ceremony. The officiating priest receives
some little gift in old silver or china, but not of money;
if, however, the parents of the child are wealthy a cheque
is sometimes given with a request that he will devote it
to the needs of his parish.</p>

<p>Tips to the nurse from the child's godparents vary from
five shillings to a sovereign according to individual means.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
